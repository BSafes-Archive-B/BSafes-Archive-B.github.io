## II. BLOCKCHAIN ILLUSTRATION
To illustrate, let’s say an individual wants to download a movie. In a traditional download, one would only connect to a single entity-owned centralized server which contains the information.<sup>31</sup> For example, if one downloads a movie from iTunes, their computer would connect to Apple’s centralized server network, and the information would be copied off the single server to their computer.<sup>32</sup> In a Peer-to-Peer (commonly, “P2P”) download, the information is taken from various servers or computers.<sup>33</sup> To facilitate a Peer-to-Peer download, the user installs a program which allows them to connect to other computers on the Peer-to-Peer network.<sup>34</sup> After browsing the catalog of “torrent files,” which are available for download, the

user can find the movie they wish to watch.<sup>35</sup> Once the download begins, the user’s computer will connect to other computers on the network (called “nodes”) which contain the file the end-user wants.<sup>36</sup> Hypothetically, with a Peer-to-Peer network, a user could connect to thousands of nodes.<sup>37</sup> The user’s computer would then only request and transfer an extremely small amount of raw data from each individual node.<sup>38</sup> Once all the information that a user needs to recreate the file on their computer is downloaded from the multitude of individual nodes, the user’s computer then recompiles the information into a usable file on their computer.<sup>39</sup> The download is finished and the user can enjoy “The Notebook,”<sup>40</sup> compiled from thousands of nodes, in the comfort of their own home.

Blockchain uses a Peer-to-Peer network to verify and record transactions.<sup>41</sup> Similar to the above, in a traditional centralized financial transaction, when a consumer swipes their debit card at a store, the transaction is relayed to a centralized server at their bank.<sup>42</sup> The bank then recognizes the amount the consumer wants removed from their account, verifies they have that amount in their account, verifies the account that the money is being paid to is receptive, and transfers the amount.<sup>43</sup> The bank then records the transaction on its internal ledgers, with the money being subtracted from the consumer’s account and added to the receiving account.<sup>44</sup>
