## Beijing’s Changing Calculus
It would be better for the United States and Taiwan if a Chinese invasion could be deterred without Washington having to threaten a greatpower war. Below, we aruge there are other options in this regard—options worth exploring. But first, it is useful to consider why China has adopted a more assertive position toward Taiwan in recent years. Informed analysts now assess there is a nontrivial chance of a Chinese invasion within the next decade. Why?

One reason is the military balance across and around the Taiwan Strait has shifted in Beijing’s favor. China’s much vaunted anti-access/areadenial capabilities mean the PLA now stands a greater chance of keeping US forces at bay than was feasible in the past, allowing the PLA to seize what it calls the “three dominances”: (1) localized command of the sea, (2) command of the air, and (3) command of information. In the event of war, China’s advanced radar systems and overwhelming missile firepower would now likely be enough to clinch victory in what Chinese strategists predict would be a “localized war under informationized conditions.”<sup>15</sup> Chinese strategists have judged such a conflict as one of both high probability and high danger, and so for more than two decades the PLA has focused on preparing for such a scenario. From Beijing’s perspective, these preparations greatly reduce the cost of action against Taiwan. As the PLA continues to modernize and gain relative advantages over other actors in East Asia, the costs of such action will continue to decrease.

On the other side of the ledger, the cost of restraint has increased for China. The cost of restraint is a critical, but undertheorized, aspect of deterrence.<sup>16</sup> It indicates the acceptability of the status quo—in this case, the acceptability of a prolonged irresolution to the dispute over Taiwan’s political status. For China, the cost of restraint is increasing as Taiwan moves further away from the mainland, particularly in terms of its core national identity. The assertiveness of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive

Party and the associated decline of the Chinese Nationalist Party are concrete representations of this shift. Since the Taiwanese view developments in mainland China and Hong Kong with alarm—especially the PRC’s anti-democratic policies—it is increasingly difficult to envisage Taiwan and China “com[ing] together and mov[ing] forward in unison,” as Xi Jinping and other PRC leaders insist must happen.<sup>17</sup> It is small wonder growing numbers of Taiwanese recoil at the idea of political union with Beijing, but if China perceives Taiwan as rejecting the principle of peaceful reunification, its leaders might see no option but to pursue a military solution.

Hawks in China blame the United States for encouraging what they see as Taiwan’s shift away from the 1992 consensus of “one China with different interpretations.”<sup>18</sup> To them, US policies of reassurance seem increasingly provocative. Whereas the United States once professed an interest in upholding the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, China now suspects a more aggressive policy that places Taiwan back under the US defense umbrella, as it was before 1979. This perception is fueled by talk of Taiwan once again serving as a useful outpost for the “free world.”<sup>19</sup>

The factors pushing China toward an invasion are not ones the United States can easily forestall. China’s military gains can be blunted, but not reversed. Nor is it possible for Washington to alter Taiwan’s domestic politics or the fervor with which the PRC opposes the idea of indefinite Taiwanese independence. Yet there are levers US leaders could pull to make an invasion of Taiwan less desirable to China. First, the United States can raise the costs of action for China via a deterrence-by-punishment strategy that threatens Beijing, not with war, but with the frustration of its other national priorities.

Second, it can reduce the costs of restraint for China by making good-faith efforts to fulfill the spirit of the US-China rapprochement vis-à-vis Taiwan. These two goals can be pursued in tandem with a view to strengthening deterrence, enhancing the long-term stability of cross-Strait relations, and thereby furthering the national security interests of both the United States and Taiwan—and, perhaps, even the PRC. In what follows, we take each lever in turn.
