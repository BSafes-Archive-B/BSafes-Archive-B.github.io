## 1. INTRODUCTION
Albeit it has a variety of defections (Ward & Baker, 2013) big data is more just another slogan: it is definitely a conceptualization that has penetrated both our personal and professional lives. Big data is a direct repercussion of the Internet especially the Internet of Things (IoT) (De Mauro et al., 2016).

The term Internet of Things was initially given in a presentation to Procter & Gamble (P & G) in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, co-founder of the Auto-ID center at MIT. The IoT makes it possible to connect people and things anytime, anywhere, with anything and anyone ideally using any network and any service (Patel & Patel, 2016) leading to the introduction of internet of everything (IoE) which is a broader concept of IoT. Cisco introduced IoE as a network that brings together people, process, data and things providing valuable information that leads to the creation of new capabilities, richer experience and considerable business opportunities.

Nevertheless, billions of people worldwide are generating huge amounts of data through the ongoing use of Facebook, twitters and other social media posts in addition to hardware devices and business transactions. In 2010, Thomson Reuters estimated in its annual report that it believed the word was “awash with over 800 exabytes of data growing”. One exabyte of data is equivalent to 1 billion gigabytes (GB). The main characteristic of Big Data is hence the sheer volume. No one can pin down how much data is being generated, but the amount of information collected is enormous.

With the exponential growing volume of information, one big question is how to deal with these huge amounts of data? This is where Analytics become handy. Big data analytics (Chiang et al., 2018) is concerned with applying appropriate algorithms and processes to derive value by running through multiple data sets. Value is about the meaningful correlations between them and using this information for a particular objective. Big data analytics provide opportunities for transforming decision-making and strategies and offer great benefits and promises (Schoenherr &Speier-Pero, 2015).

The use of Internet and IoT in the banking industry, such as mobile banking, online banking, demonetization and digital banking, has set an ongoing avalanche in the number of transactions and has led to the generation of huge amounts of data (Bedeley & Iyer, 2014) on which banks are leveraging to provide customers with a reliable and personalized experience. Thus, banking industry has moved towards customer-centric approach in order to ensure economic growth and competitiveness. In parallel, banks are being under increasing pressures to become green and sustainable in response to shifting customers’ behavior that are paying higher importance on banks’ social and environment activities.

This paper tackles how big data facilitated the shift towards customer-oriented banking services without forgetting the issue of sustainability which becomes a major concern of customers. The remaining of this study is organized in 3 main sections: Section 2 defines and exposes big data and customer centricity and sustainability. Section 3 introduces the conceptual framework that interrelates between big data, customer centricity and sustainability on the performance of Lebanese banks. Finally, section 4 shows the main conclusions of the study.
