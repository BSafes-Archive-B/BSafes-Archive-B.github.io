## Literature Review
*Contribution to Scholarship*

The purpose of the literature review is to position my work in relation to what others have already done, specifically Nazli Chocuri’s “Cyberpolitics in International Relations,” Adam Segal’s “Hacked World Order,” and Fabio Rugge’s chapter in “Confronting an Axis of Cyber,” “An Axis Reloaded?” As there is minimal research on the intersection of political science and cyberspace, I will draw my conclusions to how cybersecurity and politics intersect with the help of few trusted scholarly sources. Building upon previous research, I collected data on each of these books and analyzed how each author’s framework connects to my own research. I aim to contribute to the discussion of cyberspace conflict in international relations while demonstrating that my research addresses a gap in analyzing human behavior in cybersecurity.

*Nazli Chocuri’s “Cyberpolitics in International Relations”*  

Nazli Chocuri’s book “Cyberpolitics in International Relations” explores cyberspace as a new competition field in the international landscape, one that transcends traditional territorial, governmental, social, and economic constraints of conventional or militarized warfare.<sup>1</sup> Chocuri is an expert in international relations and cyberpolitics; in this book, she pays special attention to the transformation in the cyber domain and the rise of digital technology. She discusses how this understanding crosses into political science, power, and influence.

> *Cyberpolitics,* a recently coined term, refers to the conjunction of two processes or realities — those pertaining to human interactions (politics) surrounding the determination of who gets *what, when, and how*, and those enabled by the uses of a virtual space (cyber) as a new arena of contention with its own modalities and realities.

The seven characteristics that Chocuri lays out in her book help to define the development of cybersecurity and growing opportunities for competition and conflict, which are crucial elements to politics and the pursuit of power. In recent years, what was initially considered a neutral sphere of open interaction––created by technological advancements flowing mainly from the West––is a tool of influence.

All three case studies connect to Chocuri’s Table of Characteristics in different ways. In my first case study that discusses North Korea and the Sony Hack––a prime example of political coercion––physicality, fluidity, and accountability allow North Korea to execute its extensive hack on Sony Pictures in response to Sony’s intended release of “The Interview,” a film that critiques and mocks the North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea is granted a significant advantage when carrying out offensive attacks, but this is not just because the hack was attributed to a shadow hacker group and not the North Korean government directly. North Korea’s distant geographical location from its adversaries, in conjunction with the lack of communication technology within the civilian population, make it much easier for them to bypass mechanisms of responsibility and deny allegations made against them. In many ways, the physicality element of cyberspace is a defining characteristic of the Sony Pictures Hack.

The initial goal of Project Raven in the UAE was to monitor any malicious activity, such as terrorism, against the Emirati government. Today it is best known as a confidential initiative to surveil and spy on regional opponents. My second case study concerning the Emirati government’s Project attack on Qatar ties into Chocuri’s characteristics attribution, fluidity, and instantaneity. When the UAE hacked into the Qatari News Agency’s website and planted evidence that Qatar’s emir was in support of Iran, this prompted an instant response from the rest of the Gulf states to blockade Qatar. The Gulf’s regional politics shifted beyond what the Arab Spring did in ways that disrupted Middle Eastern security, redefined state sovereignty, and stirred chaos in the region. After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain first imposed diplomatic blockades on Qatar, Project Raven ramped up its cyber-attacks against Qatar and its media targets<sup>2</sup> but claimed no responsibility for the attack that helped spark the ongoing Gulf Crisis.

Hong Kong is in a unique position because it is a semi autonomous island that is connected to China under a “one state, two system” philosophy. Tying back to Chocuri’s Tables of Characteristics of cyberspace, permeation and participation can be seen in this case study. Permeation is a clear characteristic to the Hong Kong case as social media has become a battleground in Hong Kong’s protests, enabling activists to spread word to the rest of the world about China’s anti-democratic infiltration into the region. Social and digital media in Hong Kong is being used to enhance participation in activism against the Chinese Communist Party, though the use of technology on China’s part has censored this online activism in cyberspace.

*Adam Segal’s “The Hacked World Order”*

Politics is about exerting influence and control to gain advantage. The Internet is a crucial part to the emerging global communications infrastructure, which enables actors to use digital technology for carrying out political agendas. Adam Segal identifies technology as a new form of warfare, noting that even private companies are at the forefront of cyberspace. Out of the three case studies, Segal’s book only mentions the Sony Pictures hack of 2014. In “The Hacked World Order,” Segal classifies the Sony Hack as “a narrative thriller and parable”<sup>3</sup> attributing North Korea’s success on their geographic location and lack of communication technologies within the country. Segal identifies that because of the U.S. underestimating North Korea’s offensive and

defense cyber capabilities, the issue dragged on longer than it should have. As the Sony Pictures hack gradually unfolded during the week of Thanksgiving of 2014 and into December, North Korea became a forefront figure in international cyberspace. The Sony Hack was bold and daring, to say the least. One of the elements to cyber power that Segal identifies is “rapaciousness,”<sup>4</sup> which North Korea possesses. However, the attack was not meant to advance economic interest. Rather, the main motive was to embarrass and hurt Sony Pictures Entertainment from afar.

For a cyber-attack on a private corporation to receive worldwide media attention was particularly rare and alarming for that time. When Sony officially canceled the movie release of “The Interview,” this prompted a direct response from former President Obama. He stated that it was wrong for Sony to back down because the attack undermined U.S. values of “freedom of expression” and national security. Segal notes that, had Sony not withdrawn the movie, Washington likely would not have made an official response against the attack, and the hack would not have been as unique. Information Security expert Mathew Schwartz also echoes the sentiment that pulling “The Interview” was exactly the wrong thing to do, since there was no credibility to the Guardians of Peace’s threat. “It’s the kind of response you get when you don’t have a plan.”<sup>5</sup> Instead, Sony’s response only empowered the hackers to go a step further.

*Fabio Rugge’s “An ‘Axis’ Reloaded?”*

A great challenge of cybersecurity is attributing cybercrime to a specific person or group, especially when it comes to state-sponsored hacks. Cyber-attacks allow high-ranking officials in government as well as intelligence agencies to masquerade as common cybercriminals. In other

words, it is difficult to figure out who is really behind a virtual attack. Fabio Rugge writes the introductory chapter titled “An Axis’ Reloaded?” in the book “Confronting an Axis of Cyber” on cyberspace behavior, values, norms. He highlights that the current confrontation in cyberspace is translating, at the international level, into a massive “security paradox.” This is because cyber strategies differ by state and are sometimes perceived as aggressive or offensive, or the results of using such technologies can have detrimental effects in real world politics.

Defining rules and international cyber laws for a state’s cyber behavior is an absolute priority, especially when it comes to the use of force and coercion in cyberspace. This suggestion is brought up by Rugge, arguing that that the low level of public awareness of cyber-enabled information warfare (CEIW) is “understandable but worrisome.”<sup>6</sup> He discusses the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election as an example; when Russia meddled in the 2016 Presidential elections’ debate, the massive data leaks catalyzed a DNC scandal that eroded trust in American institutions. However, despite the hack’s severity in altering the course of American politics, it still failed to raise the public’s understanding of “the true nature of cyber threats and of the potential impact on international security.” <sup>7</sup> This is because cyberspace is the “domain of ambiguity,” where it is impossible to anticipate the scope of a virtual campaign without considering strategic, political, or social contexts.

Rugge marks 2008 as a critical year, where the first use of cyber-attacks in military operations were used during the Georgian War. Since then, various cyber-attacks have been carried out in the ongoing presence of international crises. The Qatari News Hack––a case study in this thesis– is mentioned as one of these cyber-attacks; the ongoing Gulf dispute in the Middle East quickly escalated after the alleged false statements from the UAE were planted on the

Qatari news website. As a result of Qatar being blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, tensions rose when Qatar ultimately sought out Iran and Turkey for assistance, the enemies of the U.S.-led Middle Eastern coalition against the Islamic State.

Rugge’s key point is that technological innovation is transforming societies at a rapid rate that public opinions and foreign policymakers are unable to keep up with. If we are to effectively manage cyber challenges in the political context, then we must recognize the cyber realm and the “real world” are growing more interconnected and what the consequences of using technology can have.
