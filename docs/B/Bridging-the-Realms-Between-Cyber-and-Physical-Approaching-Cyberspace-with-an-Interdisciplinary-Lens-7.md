## Conclusion
Three teachable lessons can be learned from these case studies. Time, effort, and finances that are spent on information security should be increased; second, risk analysts should consider the social and political repercussions; lastly, do not put anything on your computer that would want others reading. Sony especially received this wakeup call too late and could not resolve their errors. Common computer hygiene and security practices such as updated software and security patches, avoiding phishing scams, and using anti-virus software, can and should be supported. However, these practices are inadequate to avert persistent and sophisticated attacks, such as those from North Korean hackers.<sup>46</sup> Cybersecurity is a dynamic process involving human attackers who continue to adapt and quickly learn from their mistakes. Attacks can be endlessly inventive when motivated. As a result, cybersecurity needs people better versed in public culture and social dynamics. The history of cyberspace is relatively short, but the pace of history is rapidly accelerating as technologies, and more importantly the hackers, improve and develop.

The cyberspace grants a new way to achieve strategic advantage, particularly for small and developing powers. Whereas in the physical realm there are threats of nuclear catastrophe and warfighting, the cyber realm offers the ability to manipulate flow of information without risk of physical warfare, at least not quite as much. In one instance, the Israeli Defense Forces bombed the Palestinian cyber headquarters in Hamas in 2019 after a brutal fight between Hamas in Gaza and Israel.<sup>47</sup> The number of events that show merging between cyberspace and the physical realm will continue to increase. Simple and static approaches are not well suited to deal with continued technological advancement, increased access to technology, and changing cyberspace norms.

Every global power is caught in what the late diplomat George Kennan calls a “perpetual rhythm of struggle,” that is, a non-stop conflict between states. The increased access to technology has enabled cyberspace as a new competitive playing field in international relations for smaller powers. However, cyberspace is difficult to navigate because of how increasingly enmeshed it is becoming in international politics and security. Emmy-winning journalist Bruce Sussman describes it best: “…we, as a society, were on a two-lane road. The left lane was the physical world, and the right lane was the cyber world. Now, here we are, passing a sign that says ‘Lanes Merge Ahead.’”<sup>48</sup> Alongside further research, international and domestic communities must address the non-technical approaches to cybersecurity. The best way to do this is to employ people in non-technical roles to assist in analyzing cybercrime and risk analysis. While there have been meetings to discuss, cyberspace will still be evolving.
