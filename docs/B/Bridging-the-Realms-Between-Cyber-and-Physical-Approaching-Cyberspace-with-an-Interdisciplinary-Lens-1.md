## Introduction
Historically, only major powers––the most affluent and militarily powerful––could effectively compete in cyberspace. The field itself was defined by the few states that could afford to play. These competitive environments were understood to be where the quest for power lay in international relations. Today, cyberspace is no longer limited to the global superpowers, and it is near impossible to discuss national security without reference to cyber threats. In a digitalizing world, cybersecurity and technology are becoming more prominent in the political context.

Sometime between June 2012 and June 2013, during what Adam Segal refers to as “Year Zero,” a new era of geopolitical movements in cyberspace emerged. As a result, information and communication networks became ingrained into our political, economic, and social ways of life. Since then, we have seen significant implications for security, data privacy, and cyber laws. We must conclude that cyber conflict will only become more belligerent, and the risks will be more consequential as the Internet becomes more embedded in day-to-day life. Within cyberspace, every piece of data that is put onto the Internet is of interest because of its sizable effects in the physical world. Technology is becoming more accessible and cheaper to use, which leads to greater vulnerability online and increased cyber warfare.

While some attribute the deterioration in the cybersecurity environment to investment or infrastructure, I argue that the most crucial aspect of handling cybersecurity is addressing the subject more holistically with a political and sociological background. Recent years have shown that although we continue to invest billions into cybersecurity, we still see more sophisticated cyber-attacks each year. There are two main reasons for this. First, the rules of cyberspace and cyber warfare are not the same as physical or conventional warfare. In traditional military conflict, one must consider geographical distance or state borders. The laws and concepts of the virtual world cannot compare to the cyber realm and its infinite proximity. Second, the cybersecurity field is still evolving, and it is complicated to make sense of it. We still do not know the answers to many of the important questions, such as what is the responsibility between governments and private actors in cyber defense? What should we base international cyber norms on? What laws and policies can hold individuals, organizations, and state governments accountable across international boundaries?

The Sony Pictures Hack, Project Raven, and the Hong Kong National Security Law are explored in this thesis as three individual case studies that exemplify how cybersecurity tools are used as new methods to engage in political warfare. The Sony Hack best exemplifies how a data breach was used to coerce and threaten a corporation that mocked its ruler. The Qatari News Hack demonstrates how cyber tools are used to spy and influence regional politics. Lastly, the Hong Kong National Security Law shows how digital media acts as a new platform for protestors; additionally, this case study demonstrates the use of cybersecurity tools in censoring and surveilling anti-government opposition. In compiling this thesis, I argue that cybersecurity is a broadening interdisciplinary field that needs to consider behavioral approaches to best define the nature of cyberspace challenges. In completing this thesis, my findings support prior research that concluded that increased digitalization, technological advancement, and developing cyber-enabled information warfare have led to greater competition in cyberspace.
