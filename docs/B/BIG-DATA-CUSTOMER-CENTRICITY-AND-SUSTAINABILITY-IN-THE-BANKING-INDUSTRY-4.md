## 4. CONCLUSION
Nowadays, life is tech-savvy generating huge amounts of big data. Big data analytics helps the banking industry in capturing customer behaviors, spending and consumptions patterns. In parallel, today digitization rendered customer expectations and satisfaction higher and more complex. Banks like other businesses can benefit from big data to deliver a one step further in the personalization of products and services or what is called the “segment of one” to enhance customer experience journey and achieve customer experience management. In this study, big data is presented not just in terms of huge size but as a means to produce knowledge or useful information. Conclusively, the information extracted from different channels can help in the personalization of services and products taking into account customer social and environmental concerns as such enhancing customer experience and journey in the banking industry which will be reflected in improved sustainable performance.

Big Data need hence, to be secured in the cyber space. Cyber security has become a prime concern for any organization to prevent and deal with data security threats and to protect their customers' privacy. In the future, the Cyber security aspects of big data related to the banking industry can be subject of detailed research being key challenge faced by banks.

According to the developed framework, Lebanese banks should be agile in using big data analytics generated from multiple channels (not only the bank’s channel but also social media channels) to develop not only personalized products and services but also built these products and services around customers growing engagement on sustainability. Such steps became vital to survive severe competition and remain profitable particularly with the step in of fintech companies to banking products.

Additionally, as the Lebanese banks model was framed intertwining big data, customer centricity and sustainability based on literature review future studies may statistically test and validate this framework to improve its acceptance. Empirical studies may add or omit one or more variables to assess the effect of developing sustainable customized services that take into consideration clients’ social and environmental concerns based on analytics of the big data gathered from different and multiple channels to reach customer experience management which provides banks with competitive advantages and consequently ensure sustainable long term financial performance.
