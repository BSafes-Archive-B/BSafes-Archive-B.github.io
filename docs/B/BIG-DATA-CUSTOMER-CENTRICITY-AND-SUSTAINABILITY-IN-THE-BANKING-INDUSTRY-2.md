## 2. BIG DATA, CUSTOMER CENTRICITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
### 2.1 Big Data
Data is being created and multiplied with an incredible speed due to the capabilities offered by the rapid evolution of technology. Data are being collected from social media streams, web surfing, digital images, banking transactions records, emails, mobile applications and countless other sources (Research- Technology Management, January- February 2013). The amount of information available in the world has been growing exponentially and passed from 150 exabytes (an Exabyte is a billion gigabytes) in 2005 to more than 800 exabytes in 2010 (De Abreu Faria et al., 2013). This flow of data is expected to accelerate more with 44 times more data expected to be generated in 2020 (Gobble, 2013).

This huge amount of data is the cornerstone of the Big Data paradigm. There exist a number of definitions for big data were found in the literature. Section 2.1.1 explores some of them.

2.1.1 Big data different definitions:

1.  Large amount of data that cannot be managed nor processed through the use of traditional data management techniques” 

2. Big data means really huge data quantitatively: it is the collection of large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional computing techniques. Big data is not merely data; rather it has become a complete subject, which involves various tools, techniques and frameworks (Siddiqui & Qureshi, 2017). 

3. Big Data when conventional systems are unable to handle it. Bigness is not just about size- data may be big because of its: 
    a. Volume: there is too much of it. 
    b. Velocity: it is moving too fast. 
    c. Variety: comes in different and usually unstructured forms. And increasingly, “the rise of big data is intimately connected to the advent of what some call the “Internet of things” (Gobble, 2013).

4. Big data is more than just another buzzword: it is indeed a conceptualization that has penetrated both our personal and professional lives. Big data is a direct repercussion of the internet especially the Internet of Things (De Mauro et al., 2016). 

5. One interesting view of Big Data comes from (IBM), see figure 1: Big data analytics gives the ability to deal with high volumes, velocities, varieties or veracities of data. More holistic view of different time-scaled information is provided with High data volumes. Information in continuously updated for reactive decision making with high velocities. A more nuanced view of a subjected can be provided with high varieties of data. Data consistency, truthiness and hence trust in data is the outcome of high data veracities.

Big data is not only limited to volume, variety, velocity and veracity as per IBM definition but it additionally includes other characteristics such as value, validity, variability visualization and volatility (Owais & Hussein, 2016) that provide comprehensible data on customer vital for promoting customer centricity.

6. As the tool which allows an organization to create, manipulate, and manage very large data sets in a given timeframe and the storage required to support the volume of data characterized by variety, volume and velocity (Srivastava & Gopalkrishnan, 2015).

2.1.2 Typology of big data

The Oxford Dictionary defines Data as: “Data is the quantities, characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media”.

“Big data is “extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions”.

1. Big data is the huge amount of information that is a direct repercussion of the internet especially the Internet of Things (IOT) (De Mauro et al., 2016).

Big Data is a relatively new term that describes the enormous amount of information coming from the massive use of technology, such as mobile and internet use, pictures, e-mails, databases, multimedia, machine to machine data (smart homes, smart cars) in addition to the businesses daily transactions. The increasing number of users of multiple technology products has increased the flood of data to an unprecedented speed and has generated different types of information: structured data which is regular numeric data in traditional databases and unstructured data coming from texts messages, email, video, audio stock ticker and financial transactions (Erevelles et al., 2016).

Gathered data in its natural form is usually meaningless and need to be processed to become of value (Owais & Hussein, 2016) and information is classified big when it cannot be processed through the traditional systems from where the urge to use new data analytics to process and analyze big data. Analysis and processing of big data need to be done through non-conventional data management techniques.

Moreover, generated data cannot be verified at the source which may lead to mistakes in final results from the need to have accurate and truthiness information to deliver expected real time solutions (Erevelles et al., 2016).

2.1.3 Usage of big data in the banking industry
Digital data has snowballed, with the explosion of the internet of things, internet, smart phones and other devices (Siddiqui & Qureshi, 2017). People in institutions started to realize the massive potential of using this information to drive the organization growth and efficiency, in addition to create real value for customers (Tripathi et al., 2021). In our time, Data has been considered as essential as oil to businesses and the fourth factor of production like land, labor and capital (Bank, 2014). Thus, big data has become the key driver for institutions that rely on the value produced to improve customer satisfaction and personalized offerings.

Most of financial institutions (FI) and banks, due to their business nature, have been generating and handling huge amount of data from several sources (point-of-sale, electronic data interfaces, ATM machines, internet and mobile banking transactions, social media etc- --) for many decades (Srivastava & Gopalkrishnan, 2015). The banking industry is one of the big players in the big data generation. Banks contribution in big data is clearly reflected in its Vs characteristics as follows:

a. Variety of structured and unstructured data processed by the banks ranging from transactions history, online and mobile baking passing by the points of sales to credit scoring and various reports on risks and audit. 

b. Velocity or speediness new data is added to banks’ database such the enormous number of transactions executed per minutes resulting from the use of different banking products. Online and mobile activities and transactions have increased lately and time to produce the same volume of information (5 billion GBs) went from days (2 days) in 2011 to simply minutes in 2013 and expected to decrease more coming forward (Chandani et al., 2015). 

c. Volume: space needed to store the produced data is increasingly growing due to the use of different forms of data such as swift messages, emails, PDF, and images exchanged.

However, the big data either acquired from external sources or generated internally needs to be refined to become valuable for the users of which the banking industry. Banks need to align the use of big data with the organization mission and vision and invest in innovative infrastructure to optimize its benefits from big data. Given that institutions need innovative tools to process this information to improve insights and decision making (Chakraborti, 2019).

Big data analytics has found echoes within the financial firms particularly banks. As the number of electronic records grows, big data analytics has allowed banks to store data, analyze huge amount of information in a rapid time (real time), derive business insights and provide banks with the potential for new significant offerings (Srivastava & Gopalkrishnan, 2015). Banks need to formulate strategies and policies that base decision making on big data analytics and not on intuition (Chandani et al., 2015). Strategies should take advantage from the big data analytics regarding the following:

a. Better management of risks and fraud: banks are able to identify potential risks linked with lending processes. Big data can allow reduction of data entries errors. Big data applications can also limit the number of fraudulent or suspicious transactions and detect money-laundering transactions. 

b. Finding out the root cause of issue and failures. 

c. Customizing products and customizing marketing communication by sending individualized messages on offers that are relevant to the specific customer. 

d. Customer segmentation, customer centric, customer retention, cross selling and upselling activities. Big data allows a new segmentation approach of the customers based on their behaviors and spending patterns which in turn allow strengthening customer centricity. Proposing personalized services will improve customer experience that leads to customer loyalty materializing in customer lifetime value (Tripathi et al., 2015). 

e. Optimizing human resources by reducing to the minimum bad hiring and empowering the front line contacts with the customers. 

f. Leveraging on internal data coming from the banks’ financial statements; external data generated from e-mail exchanging, telephone banking operations, internet and mobile transactions and ATM operations; and from social media data that emanate mainly from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and from different search engines (Chakraborti, 2019). 

g. Effective customer feedback: internally through the bank’s customer support units or on social media platforms, banks will succeed in retaining customers if latters feel that their feedback was valued.

Big data, however, has a number of challenges as well, and the banks need to ensure that the following challenges are managed to eliminate any negative impacts on its strategy to adapt big data analytics to overpass a stiff competition not only locally but on an international scale (Chandani et al., 2015) and by new comers such as fintech companies.

Siddiqui & Qureshi (2017) listed some of the challenges as follows: 

a. Legal and regulatory challenges. The role of legislation and regulatory bodies are very sensitive because from one side they need to develop data usage and in the same time protect exploitation of information by criminals that may cause substantial losses. 

b. Privacy and security challenges. Security is becoming a hot topic with big data since smart products have evolved to almost everything around us (smart cars, smart homes) and any mobile terminal is lost or stolen will cause serious harms to the end user. Privacy is also an important issue because customers do not like to provide very intimate information. 

c. Organizational mindset. Organizational siloes need to be broken to upmost benefit from the available information. 

d. Data quality, visualization and integrity. Usually information cannot be screened effectively, thus wrong data will certainly lead to invalid results. 

e. Inefficient data management. Banking industry which infrastructure is old needs to invest in new innovative tool to analyze and interpret data since an inefficient data management will lead to potential loss of the benefit from data insights.

f. Compliance

Banks need to put strategies that take advantage from big data and in the same time manage successfully the many challenges it presents. One of these challenges is how to generate effective business value and obtain competitive advantages from analytics. The challenge for the banks is how to use data regarding who are their customers, where they live and what they do or at least what they do with their money in support of their customer base. Banks also face the challenge on how to handle huge volume of complex data in efficient and cost-effective way (Sun et al., 2014). Another challenge is added being the privacy and the use of personal data. In general, customers are reluctant to share intimate and sensitive personal information because they are afraid that their data are hacked.

The digital era has opened up new ways to engage with audiences and customers quick and in control of their journey become more exigent. Nowadays, banks’ customers’ expectations have increased tremendously due to the massive customized services of digital disruptors and consequently personalization becomes crucial for banks. Banks cannot compete using the same old ways of marketing campaigns and traditional techniques of targeting customers. For several decades, the majority of the banks used to distribute customers into different groups based on criteria like geographic location, demographic factors (gender, age), occupation and financial parameters (credit rating, asset levels, liabilities etc--). The standardized model of marketing segmentation and the one focusing on selling more of specific product (one size fits all philosophy) will fall short in favor of the rise of life style and interest behaviors and many other deeper insights on customers based on predictive analytics (W.Up, 2019).

Today, banks are competing intensely for customers who are expecting their banks to involve them at their “point of life” with appropriate offering and advices.

Due to the increasing number of customers favoring digitization, personalization and given the fierce competition from digital institutions and banks, the banking landscape is changing and the traditional banking methods are under the threat to becoming obsolete. Ultimately banks have to adapt their business model to align with customers’ new expectations and to ride the big data wave; otherwise, banks in their present form will become obsolete and their business model will be disrupted.

### 2.2 Customer Centricity
The availability of choices accompanied with the decline in customer loyalty has urged institutions to rethink their customer centricity approach and to provide their customers with what they want, when and where they want it (O’Byrne, 2017).

2.2.1 Definitions of customer centricity: 

1. Customer centricity is a strategy applied by an organization using technology to collect information on customer throughout the organization and using intelligence about the customers to be able to understand the current and future needs of customers (Ambaram, 2013). 

2. Customer centricity as an approach that places the customer in the middle of business philosophy, operations or ideas. Customer-centric businesses consider that customers are the main reason for their existence therefore all means are deployed to keep client satisfied (Investopedia). 

3. Institutions moved from product-centric or brand-centric and focus on the customer who is considered the most important stakeholder (Jirinova & Kolis, 2013).

2.2.2 Conceptualization
According to the above definitions, the rapid advance in technology and the higher expectations of customers who are different with particular needs and preferences have heavily impacted the business model. Today customers are looking for a more tailored and individualized experience given that their sense of loyalty has fallen. Businesses realized the urge need to switch from product or service-centric to customer centric approach since the customer is behind their presences. To remain competitive and economically efficient, businesses have to fulfill customers’ needs and satisfy their increasing expectation requirements in the way they like it and not in the way the business see it. To be able to better understand their customers and satisfy their needs in real time, businesses need to take benefit from the skyrocketing available information (Tornjanski et al., 2015).

2.2.3 Factors affecting customer centricity

The move from product to customer centric approach was enabled due to the following three factors (Ambaram, 2013):

a. Technological factors which use big data to address(1) customer relationship management systems that allow the building of a single view of a customer and (2) customer data and analytics for instance transforming collected data into executable actions. 

b. Customer factors that comprise (1) customer needs not only for the present and (2) lifetime needs, (3) customer loyalty and (4) customer experience journey. Creating a positive customer experience is key in customer-centric approach and enables a company to differentiate itself from competitors who do not offer the same experience. 

c. Organizational factors consist in: (1) customer segmentation and not market segmentation based on behavior and value and not in demographic distribution, (2) customer value or profitability including customer loyalty, (3) customer touch points where consistency should be the same across the whole organization or touching points and (4) delivering integrated solution instead of individual products.

### 2.3 Sustainability
2.3.1 Definition of sustainability

Sustainability connotes the concept of securing the present without compromising the future (Pardo-Jaramillo et al., 2020). This concept that has developed in the late eighties of last century aims at preventing the sudden and uncontrollable collapse of the world (PardoJaramillo et al., 2020). Thus, the definition of sustainability involves the three dimensions of economic, environmental and social responsible initiatives (Sheth et al., 2011). For instance, sustainability in the banking industry includes creating value for shareholders, while respecting the environment and social development (Korzeb & Samaniego-Medina, 2019). Consequently, the assessment of business results should not only focus on economic performance but also take into account the social and environmental influence.

2.3.2 Sustainability in Banking Industry

According to Tu & Dung (2017), Korzeb & Samaniego-Medina, (2019) banks involvement in the sustainable development is achieved by including environmental and social responsibility in their operations through environmental initiatives (such as recycling and energy efficiency programs) and socially responsible initiatives trough involving in social and cultural sponsoring activities (such as cultural events support, human resource practices improvement and charitable donations); Furthermore Tu & Dung (2017) added that sustainable development is also achieved through integrating the concept of sustainability into core businesses (such as integrating environmental norms into lending and investment policies and developing new products that facilitate access of capital to environmental businesses).
