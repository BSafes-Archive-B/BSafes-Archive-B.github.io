## Reducing the Costs of Restraint
One possible objection to our argument is, since reunification with Taiwan is a long-standing objective of the Chinese state—a goal motivated by nationalism, irredentism, and the Chinese Communist Party’s perpetual quest for domestic legitimacy—China’s leaders will not pause to calculate costs and benefits when weighing a decision to invade Taiwan. If this view is correct, the possibility of deterring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, whether by denial or by threats of punishment, is minimal indeed.

Analysts in the United States cannot rule out the possibility China might one day embark upon an invasion of Taiwan regardless of the costs. It would

be wrong, however, for America to base its Taiwan policy upon the belief China’s leaders are irrational, or to lock itself into a strategy that would be catastrophic if China acted recklessly. In the past, China has been persuaded the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is tolerable, despite Chinese strategists describing Taiwan as a “core interest” that admits no “room to maneuver.”<sup>32</sup> As noted previously, Beijing also recognizes other core interests such as national development, the pursuit of international prestige, and the maintenance of domestic stability—all of which might be jeopardized by an ill-judged conquest of Taiwan.<sup>33</sup>

The Chinese Communist Party has two principal objectives with deadlines: to “basically realize” “socialist modernization” by 2035 and to become a “great modern socialist country” by 2049. <sup>34</sup> Given China’s internal demographic, ecological, social, and economic challenges, these goals will be difficult for the PRC to accomplish. They will become impossible targets if a successful invasion of Taiwan is met with the punishments described above. The rest of the “China Dream” will similarly be thrown into disarray. Strategy is about balancing key interests—something Chinese leaders understand well.<sup>35</sup> In a 1975 meeting, Henry Kissinger and Mao Zedong discussed when Taiwan would return to the mainland. Mao said: “In a hundred years.” Kissinger replied: “It won’t take a hundred years. Much less.” Mao then rejoined: “It’s better for it to be in your hands. And if you were to send it back to me now, I would not want it, because it’s not wantable. There are a huge bunch of counter-revolutionaries there.”<sup>36</sup> The goal of the broken nest strategy should be to make Taiwan, given the PRC’s broader interests, unwantable.

Still, Beijing must be reassured that choosing to forgo an invasion of Taiwan would not be tantamount to *losing* Taiwan. Raising the costs of a Chinese invasion must constitute only one part of the solution to the current strategic quandary; Taiwan and the United States must also move to ease China’s costs of restraint. Washington must restate in unambiguous terms the status of Taiwan is undetermined, that the United States has no plans to support independent statehood for Taiwan, and it will not seek to shift the status quo using gray-zone tactics that violate the spirit of Sino-American

rapprochement. Simultaneously, Washington must remain implacably opposed to a forcible resolution of the Taiwan question.

Unlike strategies placing the threat of military reprisal at their core, a deterrence-by-punishment strategy does not rely on the United States bolstering its military forces in Northeast Asia. This approach leaves the United States some room to adopt a force posture capable of reassuring allies such as Japan and South Korea about their collective defense, while also convincing both Taiwan and China the United States is truly committed to maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. It also frees the US military to divest itself from vulnerable bases in Japan that may on balance make great-power war more, rather than less, likely— via a preemptive Chinese attack in an active-defense situation. Shifting the burden of deterrence from military reprisal to non-military punishment might also reduce the likelihood of a war caused by miscalculation, while also removing the pretext that China’s buildup is a response to US and Taiwanese provocations.

Of course, there are dangers associated with reducing the US military footprint around Taiwan. Careful research and planning must be conducted in conjunction with regional partners to ascertain what level and type of US forward deployment would be necessary to reassure allies while also lessening the chances of war. There should be no drawdown of military forces until such a time as a credible deterrence-by-punishment strategy has been put in place; otherwise Beijing might perceive a window of opportunity to wage a successful attack. Additionally, Taiwan might be less encouraged to stage an independent fight against China if it no longer believes the United States would (or could) intervene on its behalf. That said, given reports about low morale in the Taiwanese Armed Forces, as well as low defense spending (around 2 percent of GDP), a shock to the status quo might be just what the situation requires. Regardless, relying less on threats of force is not the same as ruling out the use of force altogether. Ambiguity will always exist about whether the United States would use force in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.<sup>37</sup>
