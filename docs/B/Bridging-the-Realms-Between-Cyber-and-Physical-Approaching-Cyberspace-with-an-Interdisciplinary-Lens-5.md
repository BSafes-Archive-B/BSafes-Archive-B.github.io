## Case Studies
*The Sony Pictures Entertainment Hack*

On November 24, 2014, Sony employees who logged onto their desktops that morning were greeted with the sound of digital gunfire and a sinister image of a red skeleton with the title “Hacked By #GOP.” Below the title read a grim message:

> We’ve already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met. We’ve obtained all your Internal data including your secrets and top secrets. If you don’t obey us, we’ll release the data to the world. Determine what will you do till November of the 24th, 11:00 PM (GMT).

A shadow hacker group, claiming themselves as the “Guardians of Peace” (GOP), carried out one of the most devastating cyber-attacks on an American private institution by sabotaging the system’s computers and stealing over 100 terabytes of data using wiper malware<sup>8</sup> and releasing that sensitive information to the general public. Though politically motivated attacks and theft of intellectual property are not new, this case study stands out amongst others because it drew an unprecedented U.S. response. What was first seen as an amateur cyber hack ultimately catalyzed a series of actions for U.S. national security.

The GOP demanded that Sony cancel its then-upcoming political satire film, “The Interview.” The film, which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen, is about two journalists hired by the CIA who attempt to assassinate Kim Jong-un, who is parodied by actor and comedian Randall Park. When the film was still being made in the summer of 2014 by Columbia Pictures, Korean officials expressed disdain over the movie as releasing such a film would constitute an act of “the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war.” A spokesman

from the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented that “if the United States administration tacitly approves or supports the release of this film, we will take a decisive and merciless countermeasure.”<sup>9</sup> The spokesman did not elaborate on this statement but noted that Washington was guilty of “provocative insanity” and tainting the North Korean supreme leader’s image. Pyongyang also wrote a letter of complaint to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to stop the production. Michael Lynton, then Sony’s chief executive, said when Sony officials called the State Department, they were told it was just more “bluster.”<sup>10</sup>

GOP hackers reportedly gained access to Sony’s networks from the inside by stealing a key password from an employee in Sony’s IT department, likely a system administrator who had broad access to the computer systems. The GOP’s technique of gaining the password is not entirely certain. Still, many speculate it was shared through a spear-phishing attack, a social engineering tactic intended to steal data. After the Sony hack was publicized later in November, several American journalists requested comment from the GOP. One GOP member, who called themselves “Lena,” told a CSO Magazine reporter that “Sony left their doors unlocked, and it bit them.” Lena added that “[Sony] doesn’t do physical security anymore,”<sup>11</sup> which made it much easier for the GOP to plant the malware.

Although Sony’s security systems were already weak, it is clear that the Sony hack was carefully executed and well thought out. The release of the stolen data came out gradually by week. On November 27, three days after employees found the message on their computer screens, five Sony films––four of which had not been released––were uploaded to an online file-sharing hub for free streaming to the public<sup>12</sup> . Following the release of these films on

December 1, the pre-bonus salaries of Sony’s top 17 executives were leaked, as well as personal information of more than 47,000 former and current Sony employees. The information uncovered from the data itself caused major upset as the numbers indicated a sizable gender pay gap between male and female employees and actors. Sony hired the FBI’s cybersecurity firm, SealMandiant, to investigate, but stolen data––from celebrity aliases, Sony workplace complaints, to passport and visa information––was still being released day by day in batches.

On December 5, the GOP emailed Sony employees threatening to harm them and their families if they did not sign a statement renouncing the company. As word of this message got out to the public media, people began to panic. Despite the paranoia, however, it should be understood that the length of the Sony Hack can be attributed to the poor responses. James Franco, who hosted *Saturday Night Live* the night after the threat, mocked the hackers in an opening monologue:

> Something pretty crazy happened this week. I have this movie called ‘The Interview’ coming out at Sony and this week Sony Studios got all their computers hacked. This is true. These hackers have leaked real personal information about everybody that works at Sony. Social security numbers, e-mails, and I know eventually they’re going to start leaking out stuff about me. So, before you hear it from someone else, I thought it would be better if you hear it from me. Soon you’ll know that my e-mail is CuterThanDaveFranco@AOL.com. My password is ‘LittleJamesyCutiePie’ — and this is all just a real violation of my personal life.

The Christmas release of “The Interview” was canceled, following another email sent on December 16, 2014 from the GOP that contained terroristic threats. “The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the [theaters] at the time. (If your house is nearby, you’d better leave).” While many thought that it was a relief to pull the plug on the movie premiere, others, specifically President Barack Obama, were disappointed that Sony listened to the GOP’s commands. “I’m sympathetic to the concerns they faced. Having said all that, I think they made a mistake.”<sup>13</sup>

On December 19, 2014, the FBI’s cybersecurity firm, SealMandiant, linked<sup>14</sup> the Sony Hack to North Korea. Though they claimed they could not share all details concerning the report for confidential reasons, they laid out three points asserting their argument: (1) Technical analysis of the data deletion malware was linked to other malwares that the FBI can confirm were used by North Korea; (2) The IP addresses<sup>15</sup> were associated with North Korean infrastructure; (3) The tools used in the hack were similar to the South Korean bank and media hacks made by North Korea in March of 2014. Although the North Korean government continually denied the allegations that they were behind the attack, the U.S. Department of the Treasury imposed economic sanctions on North Korea in January of 2015, which further intensified tension between the U.S. and North Korea.

The severity of the hack was not realized at first. As Buchanan puts it, “Sony executives apparently talked to United States officials after the North Korean saber-rattling, but neither side seemed overly concerned about the possibility of North Korean escalation.”<sup>16</sup> The BBC also quotes a tech expert wrongly predicting that the Sony hack would be less detrimental than the 2011 hack on Sony’s PlayStation. Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics research at Euromonitor, told the BBC: “This time around, I don’t believe that there will be massive damage, save for Sony’s ego, even if the hack is real.” While there was clear significant financial loss to the studio, what made the breach so catastrophic wasn’t the hack itself but the series of

events that unfolded. The breach of confidentiality and failure to secure information led to dozens of lawsuits against Sony Pictures. Below is a graph that demonstrates the data leaks and the data destruction were the two most damaging aspects.

The embarrassing secrets and of a successful multibillion-dollar entertainment company were exposed, which led to financial and legal issues that lasted for years. As the focus of the attack was centered on the public gossip about the film industry, the Sony Hack became a worldwide phenomenon. Backlash was particularly directed towards Sony producer Scott Rudin, when emails exchanges between Rudin and co-chair of Sony Amy Pascal were released. In the emails, Rudin described famous actress and activist Angelina Jolie as a “minimally talented spoiled little brat” after Jolie wanted David Fincher to direct Jolie’s film, “Cleopatra”. “YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS,” Rudin said in one email, referring to Jolie.17 Rudin also took aim at actress Megan Ellison when he referred to Ellison as a “bipolar 28-year old lunatic” who needed to take her meds. The Sony hack also showed emails disclosing racially insensitive remarks against former President Barack Obama, which caused mass criticism from high-profile celebrities like Kevin Hart and Shonda Rhimes. Pascal––while discussing breakfast at which she would be meeting President Obama––jokingly asked18 Rudin if Obama likes the movies “DJANGO” and “The Butler,” two movies centered around black men.

The Sony Hack was the start of an era where digital technologies became a choice of weapon for political coercion. Given the relative weakness of its military, and its distant geography from its Western adversaries, North Korea chose to instigate and carry out irregular cyber operations as part of their strategic objectives to steal data. “While we have yet to witness

the extremes of cyberwar, the more subtle danger since 2016 is the way states like Russia and North Korea use cyber-strategies as a form of political warfare.”<sup>19</sup> When cyberwar becomes the normal state of affairs on the Internet, states must determine what the proper response to these attacks are since they are virtual and not physical. For the U.S. to retaliate in any way to a cybersecurity breach on a private institution is alarming and can be traced back to a merge between the cyber realm and the physical realm.

In hindsight, the Sony Pictures Hack demonstrated that some of the most aggressive cyber attacks were not driven by military, security, or financial motive but by an intent to coerce another power into doing what they want. The relative easiness and inexpensiveness of technology has helped in aiding this process. “You don’t need that much money to invest in cyber warfare,” says Martin Libicki, senior management scientist with the Rand Corporation. “It is really a people thing, not a money thing,” he adds.<sup>20</sup> North Korea only has a small GDP and a thousand or so specialists dedicated to cyber warfare. Cyber-attacks are easier to perpetrate and send messages. The aftermath of the data breach left us with chilling concerns about the long-cherished right to free speech, and whether that right would have its consequences. The breach was a turning point in cyber that even a renowned global entertainment corporation could be the victim of a cyber-attack.

the Qatari News Agency. This case study primarily demonstrates how cyber tools are used to spread disinformation<sup>21</sup> and conduct espionage on state adversaries.

When news broke that the Qatari emir vocalized support for Iran and the Islamic state, it caused a frenzy in the Middle East. On May 24 of 2017, a post was found on the Qatari News Agency (QNA) website, Qatar’s official government media outlet, with a statement claiming to be attributed to the Qatari Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The statement, officially calling Iran an Islamic power and speaking positively about the Palestinian militant group, Hamas, was allegedly planted by hackers from the United Arab Emirates. The “fake news” that was posted in this state-sponsored hack whipped anger against its smaller Gulf neighbors and catalyzed an ongoing Gulf Crisis. The hack occurred just three days after President Donald J. Trump visited Riyadh during his tour of the Middle East.

On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE cut all diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing the state of financing Islamist militant groups, supporting terrorism, and allying with its Shiite rival, Iran––the Gulf states’ regional adversary. The Qatari government said its emir had never given the statement and that QNA was hacked. Despite Qatar’s protests, its neighbors––already suspicious of Qatar for supporting terrorism––quickly acted by blocking Qatar from the rest of the Gulf. When ties were officially severed, the blockading countries demanded Qatar to call back all diplomats and cancel all means of transportation, communication, and trade with them. The reports about the alleged statement were broadcasted all over Saudi Arabian government outlets. Additionally, the UAE shut down all Qatari media broadcasts inside its borders, including Al Jazeera, the most-watched satellite network in the Arab region. The day after diplomatic relations in the Gulf were severed, U.S.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for negotiations between the Gulf states to resolve the situation, however this was not successful.

On July 16, 2017, the Washington Post released an article asserting that the UAE was responsible for orchestrating the hacking of QNA and attributing the false statement to the Qatari emir.<sup>22</sup> U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI and the CIA, and British law enforcement officials found that members of the Emirati government discussed the disinformation plan and its implementation with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE Ambassador to the United States, stated to the Post that the article was false. “The UAE had no role whatsoever in the alleged hacking described in the article,” the statement said. “What is true is Qatar’s behavior. Funding, supporting, and enabling extremists from the Taliban to Hamas and Qadafi. Inciting violence, encouraging radicalization, and undermining the stability of its neighbors.”<sup>23</sup>

In a separate Reuters report, investigators uncovered that Project Raven operatives sprang quickly into action and launched operations to break into the Apple iPhones of at least ten journalists and media executives they believed were colluding with Qatar or the Muslim Brotherhood. “The goal, the former Raven operatives said, was to find material showing that Qatar’s royal family had influenced the coverage of Al Jazeera and other media outlets, and uncover any ties between the influential TV network and the Muslim Brotherhood.”<sup>24</sup> BBC host Giselle Khoury, the chairman of Al Jazeera, Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani, and other prominent Arab media figures were reportedly spied on by Raven operatives. The UAE’s security officials used a surveillance tool called Karma to surveil and steal information from the intended targets. Karma was dangerous because hackers could obtain personal information by uploading phone

numbers or email accounts into an automated targeting system. The UAE purchased Karma from an unknown source.

The UAE and Qatar have been engaged in a “tit-for-tat hack-and-leak”<sup>25</sup> operation for years. Tensions between the UAE and Qatar can be traced back to 2013 during a power struggle in Egypt. When Qatar allied with the Egyptian Islamist movement after the Arab Spring, the UAE backed a military takeover that cast the Islamists into prison. Each side has been accusing the other of cyber espionage for years, leading to multiple lawsuits and strained Gulf relations. Perhaps the UAE and its allies needed to find a legitimate reason to cut ties with Qatar and were willing to plant false information to carry this out. A few months after the rift began, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson intervened to stop Saudi Arabia and the UAE from invading Qatar militarily.<sup>26</sup> Though the U.S. is allied with the blockading countries, it has strong relations with Qatar.

The UAE hack on Qatar signaled a broader transformation in cyber espionage. It is a clear sign that cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns are no longer the exclusive domain of sophisticated powers of Russia, China, and the U.S. Like North Korea and the Sony Hack, cyber-attacks are no longer limited to Western or first-world countries because technology is becoming more accessible and affordable as the digital era becomes more present in everyday life. The rapid advancement of this technology creates an increasingly competitive cyberspace where small states such as the United Arab Emirates hold power to sway Middle Eastern politics to the point where the U.S. steps in to mediate. Many small states, especially in areas where hiring hackers is easy, find that cyber war provides a greater return than actual investment in conventional weapons.

program at the Center for New American Security, states that cyber warfare is an excellent alternative to conventional weapons because it is cheaper and far more accessible, especially for small nation-states. Essentially, it allows these countries to pull off attacks without the risk of retaliation or getting caught.<sup>27</sup>

This news hack is not the first time where the UAE attempted to meddle in other state’s affairs. In 2016, Reuters uncovered documents that revealed that the UAE had been using cyber tools to monitor other targets aside from the Qatari emir. These included a senior Turkish official Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, Oman’s head of foreign affairs Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the Saudi Prince, and even American citizens from abroad. Ex-NSA Lori Stroud confirmed as a former Project Raven operative that foreign adversaries such as Iran, Qatar, Turkey, and individuals who criticized the monarchy, were the main targets.<sup>28</sup> According to documents reviewed by Reuters, Raven was largely staffed by U.S. intelligence community veterans who were paid through an Emirati cybersecurity firm named DarkMatter.<sup>29</sup> DarkMatter did not respond to the numerous emails and phone calls requesting comment. The NSA also declined to comment on Project Raven.<sup>30</sup>

Besides Israel, the UAE has developed a reputation as a tech hub in the Arab world, attracting investments in computing from large tech corporations such as Microsoft. The UAE is a prime example of how Gulf monarchies are increasingly outsourcing defense and security work. The fact that the UAE was able to garner support from former NSA methods, knowledge, and tools for use by their own intelligence purposes is alarming. The UAE also recruited

The Qatari News Hack case study demonstrates the power of disinformation. The Emirati government’s use of cyber technology enabled them to sanction off and isolate Qatar from the rest of the Gulf states. The planting of fake statements engineered what would be one of the greatest modern Gulf crisis. “The Emiratis needed a trigger to spark the crisis and this was it.”<sup>31</sup> A hack of the QNA is also a striking example of a cyber-attack in shaping Middle Eastern politics. The UAE readily denies the allegations that they attacked the Qatari news site to this day, despite evidence that the Emirati government has been spying on Qatar since 2016 and had prior political tensions dating back to the formation of Al Jazeera.

*Hong Kong National Security Law*

The Sony Hack and Qatari News Hack case studies were examples of security breaches. They examined how technology and digital media enable small powers to sway domestic and international politics through hacking. It was clear who the perpetrators of the hack were and who the victims were. In this third case study, I will examine Hong Kong’s national security law to discuss how the People’s Republic of China uses cyber technology to carry out political and economic initiatives over Hong Kong through censorship and surveillance.

In 1984, thirteen years before the handover of Hong Kong, China and Britain signed a treaty that declared China and Hong Kong would be under the principle of “one country, two systems,” otherwise known officially as the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984. Since the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China’s (HKSAR) handover from British rule in 1997, they thrived under the authority of China but in a “one

***

country, two system” concept that was implemented in Basic Law, Hong Kong’s de-facto establishment. The declaration enshrined the city’s capitalist system and granted it a high degree of autonomy. It also helps them to reintegrate Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau with mainland China while preserving their own political and economic systems.<sup>32</sup> During this time, Hong Kong had been trying for years to pass a security law; it was unsuccessful due to an inability to reach a consensus. However, the semi autonomous region’s standing as a stable international financial center and gateway for global capital has risen above China, making it a populous city for multinational corporations and foreign investors.

On June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress imposed a security law at 11:00 PM, just an hour before the 23rd anniversary of the city’s handover to China from the British. With little input from local Hong Kong officials, this new security law established a wide-reaching security apparatus with the power to crack down on a range of political actions deemed harmful to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The law is now incorporated into Hong Kong’s “mini-constitution,” the Basic Law, but the details of the law’s sixty-six articles were not revealed until after it was passed. The Hong Kong democracy campaigner Joshua Wong spoke out in a series of tweets33 after his political party, Demosisto, was disbanding:

> [The security law] marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before. From now on, #HongKong enters a new era of terror, just like #Taiwan’s White Terror period in history, with arbitrary prosecutions, black jails, secret trials, forced confessions, media clampdowns and political censorship. With sweeping powers and ill-defined law, the city will turn into a #secretpolicestate.

The new Hong Kong law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with foreign forces with maximum life sentences in prison, resembling mainland China’s own laws. Both Chinese and Hong Kong laws include punishments for people “suspected” of inciting hatred against the government, with no elaboration. Roger Creemers of Leiden University in the Netherlands says that “vagueness is a governing tactic”<sup>34</sup> for China’s authoritarian regime. Strict punishments, which acted as a deterrent, are core to China’s control over Hong Kong. Beijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong with its own Chinese law enforcement personnel. Under the new law, Chinese officials can arrest any protestor and sentence them to life and without bail. Additionally, the law would allow for new Chinese national security agencies and formal secret police authority. Hong Kong can establish its own national security commission but with a Beijing-appointed advisor. The city has long cherished the independent judiciary, a remnant of the British colonial rule that stood in stark contrast to China’s secretive, party-controlled courts. Now, Hong Kong must address its cases according to mainland Chinese law, where the penalties for violation are often harsh. There are now questions as to whether Hong Kong will be permanently stripped of free speech and public communication.

Hong Kong’s civil unrest began when talk of plans––which did not end up happening––that would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China had spread to the public. What started as a single peaceful demonstration has snowballed into a wider pro-democracy movement, demanding state autonomy and self-rule. The urge to push for democratic reform and investigate alleged cases of police brutality followed through city-wide protests which, in turn, sparked mass upheaval for a fight to protect democratic institutions. Last year in 2019, anti-government demonstrators in Hong Kong bombarded police stations and surrounded Chinese government buildings. Some Hong Kong protesters have called upon the

U.S. in their support for democracy and freedom by waving American flags to symbolize pro-democracy and free speech. A stronger pro-democracy protest presence would also empower the U.S. government to impose sanctions on Chinese or Hong Kong officials deemed to be undermining that autonomy or committing human rights abuses.

On May 22, 2020, an explanation of the National People’s Congress’ (NPCSC) request for authorization to create new national security legislation for Hong Kong was released. NPC Vice Chairman Wang Chen cited growing risks to China’s national security in the city since the outbreak of the anti-extradition bill protests in June 2019. Wang stated that the forces that were “anti-China” were calling for Hong Kong’s independence from China, self-determination, and for a referendum on Hong Kong’s future.<sup>35</sup> When explaining China’s decision to establish a national security law, he accused that the protesters:

> …openly insulted and defaced the national flag and emblem, incited Hong Kong people to be anti-China and anti-Communist Party, besieged the Central People’s Government’s institutions stationed in Hong Kong, discriminated against and excluded people from mainland China in Hong Kong; deliberately undermined social order in Hong Kong, violently confronted police enforcing the law, damaged public facilities and public property, and paralyzed the governance of the government and the operation of the Legislative Council.

The Hong Kong national security law raises questions as to how China is using cyber technology to censor and surveil Hong Kong, as well as how technology might be used to sway Chinese politics. Many are afraid that Hong Kong’s judicial independence will be trampled and that the city’s legal system will soon resemble one of China’s, one with no right to free expression. “It is clear that the law will have a severe impact on freedom of expression, if not personal security, on the people of Hong Kong,” notes Professor Johannes Chan, a legal scholar

at the University of Hong Kong.36 The law blurs the line between software developed for national security and for individual or personal use.

Donald Trump and the White House did not say too much on the new Hong Kong law, but there have been actions to address it. On November 22, President Trump made a comment on “Fox & Friends” where he signaled support of the protestors but also pointed out his trade deal with China. In fact, Trump also spoke warmly about Xi, calling him “an incredible guy” and “a friend of mine,” <sup>37</sup> while also crediting his trade negotiation as the reason why Hong Kong was not already obliterated. Eventually, on November 28, 2019, Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy bill, which requires the U.S. government to impose sanctions against mainland China and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses against protestors. The bill received bipartisan support in the Senate and the House of Representatives––signaling support for self-determination in Hong Kong. In the eyes of the Trump administration, the Hong Kong matter is a second-tier issue compared to trade with China and North Korean and Iranian nuclear threats. However, China has and continues to repeatedly blame the protestors on foreign interference in the city.38 In an indirect way, this case study exemplifies China’s attack on Western ideology.

Hong Kong’s protesters are using their available tools to bring heightened awareness not just to cybersecurity but to Chinese-Hong Kong relations. This has allowed us to recognize how unique and so far-fetched in that the law can apply to anyone, anywhere in the world. The law’s expansive scope will especially make it difficult for data and tech companies to conduct business. Donald Clarke, a law professor at the George Washington University, noted that the

{: .fs-2}

law claims “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over every person on the planet.<sup>39</sup> Essentially, the law is broader in scope than China’s own criminal law. So, how willing are technology and financial platforms to stand up to the Chinese government, particularly when their assets are at stake? Companies like Google and Facebook halted accepting requests for data from Hong Kong authorities, while TikTok, a Chinese-owned platform, has already decided to entirely pull out of the region. “If companies like Google and Facebook refuse to comply, they could be fined thousands of dollars, and their local employees may be sent to prison for up to six months.”<sup>40</sup> Since the rules also extend beyond Hong Kong’s borders, Facebook could be compelled to produce information about a user in the U.S. if Hong Kong authorities deemed their posts a threat to China’s national security.

While China uses its resources to keep eyes on the citizens of Hong Kong, citizens in Hong Kong are fighting back by using technology to galvanize international support, hide organizer’s identities, and mobilize demonstrations. In a CNBC article, Tracy Loh, senior lecturer of communication management at Singapore Management University, stated: “what has changed now is that social media is used to win the hearts and minds of the people. Both sides are using images of police brutality and/or protester brutality to further their own agendas.”<sup>41</sup>

The case study of Hong Kong asks a crucial question: what is the balance between individual rights and state interests in the digital age? Looking at the consequences of this new law, the latter seems to outweigh the former. The use of digital technology to suppress and control flow of information is a common theme throughout Chinese cyber realm. Enforcing the 2017 Chinese Cybersecurity Law onto Hong Kong would be illegitimate; however, this law––in addition to many others related to digital technology–– could be slowly introduced by starting
