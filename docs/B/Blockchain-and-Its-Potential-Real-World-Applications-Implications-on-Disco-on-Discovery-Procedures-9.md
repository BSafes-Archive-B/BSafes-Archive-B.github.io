## IX. CONCLUSION
Blockchain is considered a disruptive technology. The widespread use of blockchain will usher in a paradigm shift in how our society stores, retrieves, logs, and interacts with huge swaths of data. We are recording more information than ever before, and because of the sheer mass of these databases, the courts should look to ways to streamline the processes as it relates to presenting the information contained on these

databases.

Blockchain was born out of a simple motivation—to make the ledgering of our transactions transparent, immutable, trustless, and decentralized. The ideal of blockchain is similar to the ideals of the American founding fathers. Consolidation and centralization can lead to corruption and a lack of accountability, leaving victims with no recourse. The blockchain system was created to bring the power to the masses as an alternative to the massive, unwieldy financial system we have today.

As the technology carries into differing ledgering systems, the ideals which spawned the creation of the technology will follow, hard coded into the processes. The technology itself is a reflection of its invention. So much so that the accuracy of the information that it produces cannot be questioned. While ESI currently requires certification from an expert for the underlying processes of the software that organizes information and reports it, soon enough all information will be ESI, and the courts will have the opportunity to streamline procedures again. Judicial notice can be one of the tools the court has at its disposal to streamline litigation, saving the litigants and the court time and money.
