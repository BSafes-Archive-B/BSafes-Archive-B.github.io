## The Broken Nest
A Chinese proverb asks, “Beneath a broken nest, how (can) there be any whole eggs?”<sup>20</sup> The proverb means if the United States cannot prevent China from seizing Taiwan by force, it should instead develop a strategy to convince China’s leaders an invasion would produce a peace more injurious than the status quo. As noted previously, the United States already incorporates the logic of deterrence by punishment into its overall Taiwan strategy. What distinguishes the broken nest approach from other deterrence-by-punishment proposals is that it does not rely upon America’s willingness to use military force; the strategy is unique in the sense that it has the potential to deter China from invading Taiwan while also reassuring all sides a great-power war is not being threatened by the United States.

Short of military reprisals, the United States could levy a number of penalties on Beijing. The most obvious first step is to make Taiwan more resilient to an invasion, such as through the purchase of the *right kind* of defensive weapons from the United States (for example, truck-mounted harpoons, mobile rocket systems, and surf-zone sea mines).<sup>21</sup> Progress has been made recently in this regard.<sup>22</sup> The more Taiwan can credibly threaten to wage a war of necessity to defend itself, the less the United States will have to threaten to wage its own war of choice. Leaders in Taipei must also convince Beijing it would face a long and costly struggle to repress Taiwan’s 23.5 million citizens.<sup>23</sup> At minimum, Beijing must anticipate widespread civil disobedience. More seriously, China could be made to expect guerrilla warfare in Taiwan and perhaps even the prospect of violence being exported to the mainland. At present, Taiwanese vary by how far they support fighting a “war of necessity” to defend their island.<sup>24</sup> For deterrence to work, it will be important for leaders in Taipei to

consolidate domestic support for resisting Chinese aggression and to build resistance capabilities.<sup>25</sup>

On its own, however, the expectation of facing a robust but eventually unsuccessful defense is unlikely to deter a Chinese invasion. Beijing must also be made to believe conquering Taiwan, while satisfying one core goal of the Chinese state, cannot be done without jeopardizing other core interests. In practice, this strategy means assuring China an invasion of Taiwan would produce a major economic crisis on the mainland, not the technological boon some have suggested would occur as a result of the PRC absorbing Taiwan’s robust tech industry. <sup>26</sup>

To start, the United States and Taiwan should lay plans for a targeted scorched-earth strategy that would render Taiwan not just unattractive if ever seized by force, but positively costly to maintain. This could be done most effectively by threatening to destroy facilities belonging to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the most important chipmaker in the world and China’s most important supplier. Samsung based in South Korea (a US ally) is the only alternative for cutting-edge designs. Despite a huge Chinese effort for a “Made in China” chip industry, only 6 percent of semiconductors used in China were produced domestically in 2020.<sup>27</sup> If Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s facilities went offline, companies around the globe would find it difficult to continue operations.<sup>28</sup> This development would mean China’s high-tech industries would be immobilized at precisely the same time the nation was embroiled in a massive war effort. Even when the formal war ended, the economic costs would persist for years. This problem would be a dangerous cocktail from the perspective of the Chinese Communist Party, the legitimacy of which is predicated on promises of domestic tranquility, national resilience, and sustained economic growth.

The challenge, of course, is to make such a threat credible to Chinese decisionmakers. They must absolutely believe Taiwan’s semiconductor industry would be destroyed in the event of an invasion. If China suspects Taipei would not follow through on such a threat, then

deterrence will fail. An automatic mechanism might be designed, which would be triggered once an invasion was confirmed. In addition, Taiwan’s leaders could make it known now they will not allow these industries to fall into the hands of an adversary.<sup>29</sup> The United States and its allies could support this endeavor by announcing plans to give refuge to highly skilled Taiwanese working in this sector, creating contingency plans with Taipei for the rapid evacuation and processing of the human capital that operates the physical semiconductor foundries.

Such a “broken nest” approach is not without precedent. Sweden made an analogous threat of selective scorched earth during World War II with reference to its iron ore mines—a key source for industrial war materials— as part of its overall strategy of anti-Nazi deterrence.<sup>30</sup> Taiwan’s threat would become even more potent than Sweden’s if Taipei made and publicized plans to target the mainland’s chip-fabrication lines using cruise and ballistic missiles, including the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation facility in Shanghai. A preplanned sanctions campaign against any chip exports to China, led by the United States but supported by South Korea and other allies, would enhance this approach.

No doubt the Taiwanese will have grave concerns about threatening China with a defensive war that likely cannot be won. The prospects of implementing scorched-earth and guerilla-warfare tactics will be similarly unappealing. It will therefore be a major challenge to make these threats credible to China, though perhaps not as difficult as convincing Beijing that Taiwan and the United States are willing to risk a great-power war over Taiwan’s political status. Paradoxically, however, it is only by making these threats credible that they will never have to be carried out. In any case, the threats outlined above—even if carried out to the maximum extent—will be far less devastating to the people of Taiwan than the US threat of greatpower war, which would see massive and prolonged fighting in, above, and beside Taiwan.

Nevertheless, it would be prudent to develop a deterrence-by-punishment strategy that does not entirely rely upon threats made by the Taiwanese. Other aspects of a this type of strategy might include economic sanctions and threats in coordination with America’s regional allies, especially Japan (the actor in East Asia with the greatest disparity between latent and actualized

power), to worsen China’s long-term regional security environment.<sup>31</sup> At minimum, the US government should take the lead in developing credible threats of economic sanctions and political isolation, focusing especially on the semiconductor sector—where many necessary high-tech inputs originate from a handful of American companies—leaving leaders in Beijing under no illusions about the punishments that would flow from an invasion of Taiwan. More severely, the United States might signal an attack on Taiwan would lead to a green light for allies such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia to develop their own nuclear arsenals. If China can be made to believe invading Taiwan will result in one or more additional nuclear powers aligning against it, then this possibility ought to be an effective deterrent.

Such threats would have the advantage of making the Taiwan issue not just a battle of wills between the United States and China, but a fundamental question of what China wants its place in the region and wider world to be. Does China want to provoke the ire of its Asian neighbors, or would it prefer to advance its ambitions of regional leadership and peaceful cooperation? Again, the purpose here must be to convince Chinese leaders invading Taiwan will come at the cost of core national objectives: economic growth, domestic tranquility, secure borders, and perhaps even the maintenance of regime legitimacy.

On their own, none of these expected punishments would suffice to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Taken together, though, they might prove effective. If calibrated properly, a deterrence-by-punishment strategy would make an attack irrational from the Chinese perspective. This result must be the goal of a US and Taiwanese joint strategy.
