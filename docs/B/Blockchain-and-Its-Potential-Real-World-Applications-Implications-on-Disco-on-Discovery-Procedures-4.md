## IV. PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND PERMISSIONED BLOCKCHAINS
At this stage in the technology’s evolution, most blockchain users are familiar with public blockchains.<sup>76</sup> These blockchains

are open to any member of the public to supply processing power to the system.<sup>77</sup> Anyone with the will and investment capital can purchase machines<sup>78</sup> that supply raw processing power to the system (“mine”), giving them a chance to be awarded with cryptocurrency. Additionally, public blockchains allow members of the public to view all transactions that occur on the blockchain (“explore”).<sup>79</sup> Any individual may also view the various transactions that occur on the blockchain using an “explorer.”<sup>80</sup>

Depending on which blockchain is being explored, the information that can be obtained generally is the “account information”<sup>81</sup> associated with both the transferor and transferee, the amount being transferred, and a timestamp of the transaction and information associated with the mining of the transaction (i.e. hash and miner).<sup>82</sup> In this way, any person who knows an “account holder’s cryptographic key” (known as a “digital wallet address”) can see all transactions associated with that key.<sup>83</sup> This gives the transactions that occur on a blockchain a huge amount of transparency to the public.<sup>84</sup>

While the information associated with the *transfer* is public,

<sup>78</sup>. Although Bitcoin began with miners using their home personal computers to mine, new machines, created with the sole purpose of mining cryptocurrency (called Application Specific Integrated Circuits, commonly, ASICs), are the gold standard for mining. Individuals are still welcome to mine with their home PCs; however, the likelihood that a PC miner would be awarded cryptocurrency is much lower as they do not have comparable speed in solving the “cryptographic puzzles.” Gareth Jenkinson, *GPUs And ASICs— A Never Ending Battle For Mining Supremacy,* COINTELEGRAPH (Apr. 18, 2018), https://cointelegraph.com/news/gpus-and-asics-a-never-ending-battlefor-mining-supremacy.

information regarding the account holder is not.<sup>85</sup> To identify who specifically is transferring or receiving the currency, one must know the “public key hash” associated with the “account.”<sup>86</sup> This information is not publicly available, which requires businesses to have first-hand knowledge and registration of personal information.<sup>87</sup> Cryptocurrency companies are only in the beginning stages of requiring such personal information to be registered, if at all.<sup>88</sup> The lack of requiring this “account holder information” has led to the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.<sup>89</sup> One of the most infamous examples is the use of Bitcoin by users of the Silk Road marketplace, an online black market where users could purchase drugs, fake driver’s licenses, stolen credit card information, child pornography, or a hitman, amongst other things.<sup>90</sup>

Such illicit uses of cryptocurrency have implicated concerns regarding “Know Your Customer Requirements,” which stem from the USA Patriot Act of 2001.<sup>91</sup> Legislators are encountering difficulties in reigning in the “Wild West” period of Cryptocurrencies.<sup>92</sup> These difficulties have slowed the adoption

of cryptocurrency among general consumers and the Financial Services industry at large.<sup>93</sup> In 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) began issuing “BitLicenses.”<sup>94</sup> These licenses are granted once an applying company in the cryptocurrency market is within compliance with the statute.<sup>95</sup> The statute requires, *inter alia*, companies seeking licenses to maintain records of “the identity and physical addresses of the party or parties to the transaction that are customers or account holders of the Licensee . . .,”<sup>96</sup> bringing the anonymity of the user of cryptocurrency to an end. As of yet, there have only been a limited number of “BitLicenses” issued.<sup>97</sup> At least one court case has been filed challenging the NYDFS’s authority to regulate Bitcoin; however, the case did not reach the merits, as the petitioner did not have standing to file the suit.<sup>98</sup>

A number of blockchains exist, which claim to more closely protect the anonymity of the “account holder.”<sup>99</sup> When viewing an explorer of these “Privacy-Oriented” blockchains, information that would regularly be available to a user of an explorer of other blockchains is obscured.<sup>100</sup> While not publicly viewable, this account information is still stored on the chain and is within the purview of information which can be subpoenaed.<sup>101</sup> While “Privacy-Oriented” blockchains utilize anonymity protocols to

ensure user anonymity, they are under the umbrella of “Public” blockchains as the mining is still controlled by public users.<sup>102</sup>

“Private” and “Permissioned” blockchains differ because access to both mining and exploring are given to a limited number of partners within a consortium.<sup>103</sup> This has the advantage of quickening the verification of transactions and giving greater control to the members of the consortium.<sup>104</sup> However, the heightened degree of centralization of Private blockchains creates a heightened risk of having a singular weak point for attack.<sup>105</sup> Also, Private blockchains produce less incentive to supply a greater amount of processing power to the system, making it possible for a hacker or bad actor with control over a great amount of processing power to overwhelm the system and alter records.<sup>106</sup> Private and Permissioned blockchains trade off the “immutability” of the system for a greater degree of control of the verification of transactions.

In 2019, Facebook announced its move into the cryptocurrency space.<sup>107</sup> Facebook intends to create a cryptocurrency, named “Libra,” hosted on a Private blockchain mined by a consortium it established called the “Libra Association.”<sup>108</sup> Although Libra will not technically use blockchain as the basis of its cryptocurrency, its verification

algorithm still retains some resemblance to traditional blockchain systems.<sup>109</sup> Facebook initially retained a large number of global players within the association, but many of them backed out, citing a lack of regulatory structure and feasibility.<sup>110</sup> It is likely that Private blockchains will become more prominent as mainstream adoption progresses. Financial Service institutions, desiring greater control over all aspects of their transaction facilitation, will likely utilize Private blockchains, allowing them to claim the benefits of blockchain while simultaneously retaining full control over their systems.
