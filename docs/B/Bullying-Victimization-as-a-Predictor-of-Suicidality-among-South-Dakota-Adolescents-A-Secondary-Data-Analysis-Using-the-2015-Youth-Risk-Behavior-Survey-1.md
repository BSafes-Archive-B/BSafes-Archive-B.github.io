## INTRODUCTION
Bullying is a widespread form of peer victimization among adolescents (youth between 12 to 19 years of age) in the United States. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), about 24% of high school students in the U.S. experienced some form of bullying victimization in 2015 (CDC 2015). Bullying victimization is linked to a variety of negative outcomes including: lower school engagement and academic achievement, depression, substance use, depression, and suicidality (Espelage and Holt 2013; Holt et al. 2015; Lad, Ettekal, and Kochenderfer-Ladd 2017; Luk, Wang, and Simons-Morton 2010). Mental health professionals advocate the use of a public health approach to address bullying – a model that first requires those responding to understand the scope and consequences of the problem (Hertz, Donato, and Wright 2013; WHO Violence Prevention Alliance 2017). However, much of the data and research on bullying victimization available is at the national level and thus may not accurately reflect local conditions – especially in states which are less demographically representative of the U.S. population. By some estimates, bullying victimization may impact anywhere from 20% to 56% of young people (Hertz, Donato, and Wright 2013). More localized data and research provide those responding to bullying with a better understanding of the scope and consequences of bullying victimization in their locale, which is useful for informing an effective response.

This study used a secondary data analysis of data from the CDC’s 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey to better understand bullying victimization and its association with suicidality (defined as either suicidal ideation or attempts) within the state of South Dakota. Toward this effort, we aimed to accomplish two goals: 1) describe the scope of bullying victimization and suicidality in South Dakota relative to the U.S. and 2) test bullying victimization as a predictor of suicidality among adolescents in South Dakota.
