## V. ALTERNATE USES FOR BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
At this point, this Comment has only discussed blockchain in the context of financial systems and ledgering of transactions. However, the raw processing power that miners supply to the system need not be used *only* for financial transactions of the currency that the blockchain rewards. There are multiple potential applications, as blockchain is merely a technologically advanced form of ledgering and record keeping.<sup>111</sup> We may see a time when all record-keeping systems utilize either Public or Private blockchains, but adoption is still in its infancy, even as we see some of the largest tech companies make their foray into the blockchain space.<sup>112</sup>

One of the applications already underway is “Smart Contracts.”<sup>113</sup> In 1994, prior to the formal introduction of

Bitcoin, a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptography expert named Nick Szabo conceptualized and wrote an article outlining the theory that computers can be used to execute contracts.<sup>114</sup> He described smart contracts as “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.”<sup>115</sup> Szabo viewed everyday contractual obligations as being well within the realm of computer processing systems.<sup>116</sup>

For example, let’s say a general and subcontractor have an agreement on a payment schedule. Payment is made as the work progresses. With a smart contract, the obligations of both parties can be coded within a separate program that runs on the blockchain.<sup>117</sup> Once certain obligations are met, the contract will self-execute and automatically make a payment to the subcontractor.<sup>118</sup> The money held in escrow is automatically released into the subcontractor’s account without the need to write checks, verify payment information, or even create a tax form. All of the contract necessities will be executed upon completion of the performance of the contract.

Theoretically, the decentralized and immutable nature of the contract will leave little room for “human error” in executing the contract, making non-payment or late payment a thing of the past. However, issues may arise during the coding of the contract, which is analogous to today’s traditional contract drafting.<sup>119</sup> The “rigidity” of the coded contracts may lead to a relatively undesired effect; however, courts generally will be

able to view the obligations of a contract with more clarity.<sup>120</sup> The only remaining issue is whether the smart contract’s code truly reflects the parties’ intention when it was memorialized rather than a lapse in execution which leads to a breach.

In addition to smart contracts, other legal services may be served by the decentralization, visibility, immutability, and trustless nature of blockchain technology. One industry that may be on the chopping block due to the disruptive nature of blockchain is the title insurance industry.<sup>121</sup> As it stands today, real property title searches require an insurance reporter to scour thousands of land records contained in County Clerk offices across the country.<sup>122</sup> The industry is huge, raking in billions every year by ensuring buyers are buying what the seller owns, rather than what they *might think* they own.<sup>123</sup> In recent years, the title insurance industry has drawn the ire of consumer protection agencies and even some governmental authorities.<sup>124</sup> In fact, the state of Iowa created its own public title guarantee service.<sup>125</sup>

With blockchain, a parcel of land can be added to the blockchain ledger land registry. This blockchain would most likely be a government entity with public access, meaning that the government will control the mining process while allowing the public the ability to explore.<sup>126</sup> Every transaction, repair,

and capital improvement can be listed on the blockchain. If the land registry blockchain is public, any individual will be able to look up a property and see all important occurrences related to the property. Public access to these registries will bring efficiency and clarity to all transfers of property. When a longrunning, searchable log of every transaction which occurred exists, and the validity of the log cannot be questioned due to the nature of blockchain, the need for an industry to conduct indepth title searches will dissipate. The massive improvements to efficiency that can result from applying blockchain to title registries will have a significant effect on land title disputes.

At this point, the crux of this Comment has been reached. When something occurs on the blockchain, whether it is contractual obligations, title, or other potential applications such as logistical tracking, how will individuals prove it in court? Will blockchain ledger events require belabored discovery and confirmation of the validity and accuracy of the event and underlying processes which allow the blockchain to be explored? Or will it be as simple as a judge taking judicial notice that such an event occurred, or such obligation was met because of its presence on a particular blockchain that is widely understood as self-authenticating?
