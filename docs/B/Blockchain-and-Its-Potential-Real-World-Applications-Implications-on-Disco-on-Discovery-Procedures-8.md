## VIII. PUBLIC POLICY OF COST SAVING
The judiciary does not stand as an inflexible institution condemned to hand down authoritative proscriptions from on high. The judiciary strives for flexibility and the ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of its jurisdiction. This is important because as a process or function in society becomes standardized, courts are not resigned to remain blind to the ongoing evolution. Processes change, become cheaper, and more readily accessible to the common person. Courts regularly cite public policy to update their principles to the realities of modernity.<sup>182</sup> As social norms and technologies evolve, courts hope to be a part of that evolution.

One of the most prolific examples of the desire for technological adaptation is the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (“PACER”) (also known as Case Management/Electronic Case Files (“CM/ECF”)). In response to the invention and proliferation of the internet, courts took the opportunity to streamline and update their procedures.<sup>183</sup> Today, litigants no longer must run to the courthouse before the eve of the expiry of the statute of limitations. Filing an action is as simple as uploading a PDF and making an online purchase. The federal court revels in the new availability, cost effectiveness, efficiency, and archivability the expansion of CM/ECF has created.<sup>184</sup> Most importantly, the public policy of efficiency of the judicial economy is well served by this transition. Not only does the court require less clerks to receive the filings, but also less backend work of organizing and

delivering the filings to the specific court part. Parties upload their information directly to the case files which are available to the court.<sup>185</sup> Courts can even set alerts to learn when a new filing has been uploaded.<sup>186</sup>

Courts are not concerned only with management of the public purse. Courts also desire to ensure that litigants are not throwing their money away in protracted litigation. Fee shifting, dismissal and sanction of frivolous case files, a desire for and implementation of settlement conferences, inter alia, all stand as evidence of the courts’ desire to save litigants money. The use of judicial notice also serves this goal. Judicial notice allows the court to avoid the cost of a litigant to procure the testimony of someone with knowledge. Judicial notice allows streamlined procedures permitting litigants to focus on the actual issues in contest.

In this context, judicial notice of transactions which occur on the blockchain will allow for more streamlining of the procedure. This may be extremely important in a future where blockchain is the underlying structure of many of the ledgering systems. One can imagine a case where information on various blockchains is necessary to the outcome of the trial. With the court taking judicial notice of the propriety of the information, which was pulled from the blockchain, the court could avoid numerous days of foundation laying, cut through the procedural red-tape, and get directly to the issues at hand.
