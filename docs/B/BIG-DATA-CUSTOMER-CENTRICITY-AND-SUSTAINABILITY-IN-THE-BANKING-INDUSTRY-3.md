## 3. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR LEBANESE BANKS
### 3.1 Intertwining Big Data, Customer Centricity and Sustainability in Banking Industry

3.1.1 Big Data and Customer Centricity
Technology and communication advancement, combined with the explosive growth in information, have given rise to a more empowered global customer (EY). Nowadays, customers have different higher expectations given their geographically diversification and demographically variation. For example, in developed countries, the customer expectation of the aging population that is heading toward retirement is not the same as the new generation of customers raised on technology that is coming of age. In addition, mobile workforce has been introducing new purchasing behaviors across different geographic regions and switching needs and behaviors. Thus, satisfying more complex customer expectations is becoming more complex.

Customers who are looking for a more personalized and rich experience (Tripathi et al., 2015) become quickly frustrated from the businesses that overlooked their expectations and are ready to leave even more often than finding a better price or service somewhere else. Therefore customer centricity becomes vital given the continuous drop in the cost of switching even for the strongest corporate brands which are also vulnerable (Marous, 2017).

Banks’ customers are no exception; banks are requested today to provide more personalized timely and relevant communications and offers to drive customer’ssatisfaction and loyalty (Marous, 2017). In effect, customers’ expectations have risen and customers are expecting from their banks the same experience that they receive from financial technology intitutions and from the latest application-based innovation. Like other businesses, banking customer centricity need to be enforced in bank’s strategy and align business objectives to changing customer expectations; millennials for example desire from their banks to provide them with information and advice and not only to offer them transactional relationships (Beatty, 2018).

Banks need break the siloes and to spread customer-centric philosophy across all organizational level and empower employees at touching points to be effective and create the required personalized customer experience journey (Indriasari et al., 2019).

Customer centricity in banking is not fully implemented since most of the banks are still applying the generic solutions that lack relevance and context for targeted customers. For example, the banks’ agents promote the same mileage rewards credit cards to all the clients without really understanding whether this product add value to this specific client (is the customer interested in travelling or no); these promotions are related to the banks’ desires to sell more of a particular product (Beatty, 2018). Digital technology and advanced data analytics help banks to improve customer expectation by envisaging customers’ financial behaviors and offering them appropriate tailored financial product that fit them at the right moment (Beatty, 2018; Marous, 2019; Indriasari, 2019). For example, if a bank’s customer purchases at a shopping mall, his bank can provide him with real-time offers that are related to his spending patterns and offer him discount at his favorite store.

Churning the massive amount of information into actionable insight allow banking sector to move one step forward in customer-centric approach and reach the “segment of one” which is an advanced level of personalized experience where needs are matched to solutions in real time (Marous, 2019). The use of advanced analytics and personal financial management enable banks to meet each of their customers at his point of need and to provide him with financial advice and suggest solutions. Enhancing and supporting customers at the personal level will lead to increasing customer satisfaction and consequently pave the way for customer loyalty and retention (Tripathi et al., 2015).

To meet the skyrocketing customers’ expectations and their increasingly complex perceptions in addition to the shift in power from providers to customers, successful institutions have switched from the focus on customer relationship management to embrace customer experience management considered as sustainable source of competitive differentiation (Holmlund et al., 2020). Customer experience management which is crucial for institutions to sustain long-term customer loyalty analyzes the behavior of customer by analyzing customer’s data pattern collected from the multiple channels used and not only restricted to the service provider channels (Holmlund et al., 2020). Furthermore, these successful institutions have been employing a global perspective (what do customers really think?) and innovative channel strategies (how do customers want to be reached?). They have been providing an end-to-end experience that reveals a universal and multidimensional view of the customer rather than internal structures and organizational complexity (they see their business through the customer’s eyes). For instance, big players in electronic commerce and social media are developing marketing strategies that are oriented towards hyper-personalization or “the advanced and real time customization of offering, content and customer experience at an individual level” or segment of one (W. Up, 2019). They actively change their pages based on customer’s behavior. For example Amazon monitors in real time what a customer is viewing or buying and dynamically modifies its page to feature applicable items. By doing so they are able to reach the right customers at the right times in the right channels, they engage in a mutual exchange of information and deliver appropriate customer experiences that achieve the brand promise and create trust and long-term loyalty.

Competition is intensifying in the banking industry; in addition to the traditional players, competition now comes virtually from any region of the world and from nonbanking institutions (Fintech). Therefore, the ability to provide a differentiated and satisfying customer experience may create competitive advantage and capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth for institutions(Indriasari et al., 2019). Businesses create customer trust and loyalty by designing highly relevant tailored customer experiences that reveal a profound understanding of preferences and intentions of specific customer segments and by considering various customer values (timeliness, trustworthiness and suitability as well as price instead of focusing on one component, such as price, at the cost of the others. Thus, a trusted relationship will always remain a distinctive differentiator and will translate in profitable one.

Banks having big reservoir of data need to follow this path and analyze all available data whether structured or unstructured, from internal or external sources to digest user behavior. This will allow a better understanding of the customer perceptions and use these data insights to find new ways to cater to his needs to optimize customer experience and journey accordingly and create individualize customer experience (Indriasari et al., 2019). Personalized experience makes customers feel special, unique and happy and consequently banks will be happy (Tripathi et al., 2015). From where the urgent need for banking to increasingly consider customers, adjust to their preferences by providing timely personalized and appropriate communications and offerings that drive customer profitability, happiness and long-term loyalty (Tripathi et al., 2015).

The fast advance of communication technology and electronic commerce has ruined customer loyalty by eroding intermediaries and creating more suitable access to product information, purchase options and services.

Bank’s marketers need to forget about using the same old-fashioned data sources and marketing process and to create omnichannel customer experiences (Marous, 2017; W.Up, 2019).

Nowadays, the customer’s purchasing practices become unpredictable. Customers typically start using one channel and shift unpredictably to other channels due to personal circumstances (Marous, 2017).

3.1.2 Customer-centricity and sustainability

Banks have enormous reservoir of information collected from their daily operations and from external sources (social media) (Indriasari et al., 2019). The big wave of the technology advancement that obliged banking industry to ride the wave of change and adapt their model around technology products which moved banking operations more and more towards digitalization that started earlier, first, with the ATM than mobile banking and evolved further to the mobile and banking online. The digitization of the banking industry is generating a huge amount of data in different forms (structured and unstructured) and the data growth stream is expected to exponential going forward due to the shift in customer preferences (millenials) from face to face to digital banking (Marous, 2019). This huge amount of information has paved the way for the era of big data (Holmlund et al., 2020). The process of data has provided the banks with a 360 view on customers particularly with the insights related to customer behavior. Such insights open the door widely for the banks to further develop their customer-centric strategies engaging big data in delivering a more hyper- individualized services and create competitive advantage to escape stiff competitions facilitated by the digitization particularly that nowadays, the majority if not the totality of the businesses became customer-oriented placing the satisfaction of customers in the first place. Banks are also following this path, but banks are still behind due the existing of siloes and heavy regulations. The literature review showed that the big data have positive influence on the customer centricity in the banking industry. Moreover, the negative influence of the big data on customer centricity can be minimalized by establishing a trustful relationship that demolishes the barriers and allow customer to provide private and sensitive information.

Big data provides new behavioral insights that can be used to push further the customer-centric approach and link it to sustainability phenomenon. The banking industry needs to grasp this opportunity to create a win-win situation. Banks also need to move from the traditional way of thinking when developing a product or service to adapt with the innovative big data thinking to gain customer loyalty. Banks need to invest in big data tools to be able to detect customer’s behavior and propose a relevant personalized service or product. For instance, banks can analyze a specific customer behavior by analyzing his spending patterns, his financial means and dig further to his social life to provide him with a specific product that meets the needs of the client and prevents him from crossing his financial limits that can be harmful for him. For example, a customer under student loan, big data allows tracking his spending behaviors and detecting whether he is using his credit card to buy books and or scientific journal or spending the loan in night clubs or on stuff that are not related to the approved purpose. This behavior will be analyzed and customer will be added to the bank’s watch list for customer of higher risk. If such behavior continues the bank may take action and request prepayment of the loan.

Another example, the case of a fresh graduate that was granted housing loan with a good track record, analyzing his spending patterns reveal that he is concentrating his purchases to improve his house, the bank may provide him with credit cards that offer him discounts at many home appliances and furniture stores of his choice.

Moreover, banks can use big data to detect client’s mobility and provide him with the right products for example if customer that used to work near a branch has opened an account there. His company transferred him to another country and he bought a travel with his credit card; the bank should be proactive and propose on the customer a credit card or an account denominated in the currency of the country the customer is moving to. This is not the end; the bank needs to keep tracking the customer’s movement proposing each time an appropriate solution that fits his new situation

Thus client’s experience journey will be enhanced and customer loyalty and retention are gained (Indriasari et al., 2019). Moreover, this customer can play a role in marketing the bank service either directly to his friends or through social media.

However, while focusing on big data to reach customer-centricity approach, banks should not only take into consideration the financial behavioral of its customers but also their social and environmental concerns. In this regards, Sheth et al. (2011) presented the notion of “customer-centric sustainability” which refers to the “impact of marketing actions on environmental, personal and economic wellbeing of customers”. Therefore, banks should take into account the global raising concerns on environmental issues and work on developing strategies that not only target customers but also include long term perspective with social and environmental integration that reflects the sustainable development for all stakeholders to improve their reputation after repetitive financial crisis (Pardo-Jaramillo, 2020). Strategies include participating in social and environmental events, developing and promoting innovative products and services that respect sustainability, facilitating the access of capital for the institutionsthat respect social and environmental sustainability. For instance, banks can introduce sustainable project finance for their client to improve awareness and promote green loans such as solar panels, smart fuel consumption buildings that target a niche of its clientele based on the analytics of big data generated in the market where the bank operates, Furthermore, develop degradable credit cards or that downloaded application in mobiles phones instead of using plastic cards.

### 3.2 Intertwining Big Data, Customer- Centricity and Sustainability in Lebanese Banks
3.2.1 Conceptual framework
Given that Lebanon enjoy economic and personal freedom, large amount of data are released from the use of multiple channels such as social media, banking channels such as mobile banking, ATMs, online banking and many other channels. Consequently, Lebanese banks should be agile in leveraging on big data to timely provide customized experience and journey to their clients to be able to amend mind-sets towards customer experience management that ensure customer long-term loyalty and as such provide banks with sustainable sources of competitive differentiation. However, while concentrating on customer-centricity Lebanese bank should also integrate social and environmental activities into their operations given the growing environmental concerns from the people-potential client of the banks.

For instance, banks should be agile in putting strategies leveraged on big data that comprise both customer centricity and sustainability. Strategies such as modernizing banking infrastructure to benefit from technology capable of providing useful data and customized services, customer lifetime value, redesigning the role of branches (i.e. changing the habits, believes and experience of the personnel), digital security layering, shifting towards green banking by implementing tough rules in this subject and supporting environmental conscience companies by supplying cheaper capital.

Well-developed strategies are crucial to overcome the negative impact of big data on customer centricity in banking industry particularly regarding (1) the collection of quality and accurate data otherwise the customer experience and journey will be hurt (2) filling the gap of legal and regulatory delays on the use of data and (3) sensitive information protection. As such, the following conceptual framework is built

3.2.2 Customer-centricity and sustainability for lebanese banks
Banks in Lebanon are the main financial intermediaries that have large contribution in financing the economy.

During the last decades many banks in Lebanon started to acknowledge the importance of sustainable development and introduced many sustainable practices in their operating activities through constructing green headquarters which are energy efficient, and promoted awareness among employees on paper, water and electricity consumption behaviors, sponsoring social and cultural events, encouraging environmental activities and providing subsidized green loans mainly loans for the installation of solar panels.

At the same time, these banks particularly the Alpha group banks have been heavily investing in new technology that is more flexible than the existing core system and allows breaking the banking siloes through the consolidation of all operations executed by the same client in one system that facilitate the capture of client’s needs and preferences. Such steps enable banks in Lebanon to move from product to customer centric by leveraging on the large amount of data generated from customers’ different spending behaviors detected by the usage of banks channels and other channels such as social media.

However, the usage of big data to mutually integrate between customer-centricity and sustainability is not yet realized by Lebanese banks. Therefore, it is necessary for Lebanese banks to intertwine customer-centric with sustainability to achieve competitive differentiation needed for sustainable performance and growth.
