## REVIEW OF LITERTURE
### BULLYING DEFINED
Bullying is a form of peer victimization where children are targets of physical and verbal harm by other children. Bullying also involves an imbalance of power where those who have real or perceived higher power victimize those with less power (US HHS 2017). This imbalance has the ability to change based on a number of social dynamics, including the involvement of bystanders and potential development of bully-victims (those who bully and are victimized by bullying) (CDC 2014). Bullying victimization, the experience of being bullied, is often a repeated experience or “has the potential to be repeated, over time” (CDC 2014:2). While the term “bullying” is often used as a single kind of phenomenon, there are several types of bullying which may occur via different venues, including traditional (“in person”) bullying and cyberbullying.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services (US HHS 2017) identifies three types of bullying: verbal, social and physical bullying. Verbal bullying is when someone says something negative toward another person. This would include any form of teasing, intimidation, racist remarks, name-calling, or even threats of harm. Social bullying, also known as relational bullying, is designed to ruin or hurt someone’s social reputation or relationships. Often people that are socially bullied are purposely socially excluded, may have rumors spread about them, and consequently have few friends because the person bullying persuades others to avoid the victim. Lastly, physical bullying involves physically attacking someone to cause short- or long-term damage. This typically would entail hitting, tripping, pushing, or even damaging personal property (US HHS 2017). Verbal and social bullying may or may not be “traditional bullying” (sometimes called “school bullying”) or that which manifests in a school or other in-person environment (Schneider, O’Donnell, and Coulter 2012). Unlike physical bullying, verbal or social bullying can occur electronically.

While traditional bullying typically occurs on school grounds, playgrounds, or the bus, cyberbullying, alternately “electronic bullying,” is yet a different form of peer victimization. Cyberbullying is a form of behavior that aims to intimidate or threaten an individual or a specific group via electronic communication (US HHS 2017). This would typically include the use of electronic technology such as cell phones, e-mail, social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and text messages (Hinduja and Patchin 2010). Like traditional bullying, cyberbullying may include verbal bullying as well as social bullying. One significant difference between traditional bullying and cyberbullying is that unlike traditional bullying which may occur in one central location (e.g., school), cyberbullying is decentralized and perhaps thus more difficult to escape (Görzig and Frumkin 2013). This gives rise to a somewhat panoptic experience where bullying victimization may occur at any time and even “on-the-go” via smartphones or other mobile devices (Görzig and Frumkin 2013). With the advent of new forms of electronic communications (e.g., Facebook, Snapchat, Facetime, virtual reality), researchers are only beginning to understand how these forms may be used by adolescents to victimize one another. Regardless of type or medium of bullying victimization, it is clear that the resulting harms may be extreme enough that they may contribute to an adolescent considering ending his/her own life.

### BULLYING & SUICIDALITY
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for teenagers in the United States (VanOrman and Jarosz 2016). The suicide rate among teens (ages 15-19) is around 8.7 per 100,000 and varies depending upon a variety of related variables (e.g., gender, poverty, sexual orientation) (CDC 2017; Silenzo et al. 2007; VanOrman and Jarosz 2016). Though suicide has a number of complex and interrelated predictive factors, the association between bullying victimization and suicidality is well-established.

In this study, suicidality includes both suicidal ideation (thoughts of suicide) and suicide attempts (Holt et al. 2015). Probably one of the most comprehensive contemporary studies on bullying and suicidality was conducted by Holt et al. (2015). Holt et al. (2015) used a multilevel meta-analysis of 47 studies published from 1990- 2013 to test the relationship between bullying victimization and suicidality. Holt et al. (2015) examined three types of predictors commonly employed in bullying and suicidality studies of adolescents, including: bullying perpetration, victimization, and bully-victim – incidents where a person is both a perpetrator and victim of bullying. Ultimately, Holt et al. (2015) found that all three were significant predictors of suicidality across the studies analyzed with bully-victims being most strongly associated with suicidal ideation and bullying victimization predicting significant positive moderate effects on suicidal ideation (Holt et al. 2015). In addition to Holt et al. (2015), other researchers focused more specifically on examining the medium of bullying (traditional vs. cyberbullying) as a predictor of suicidality. Hinduja and Patchin (2010) found that both traditional bullying and cyberbullying are significantly associated with suicidality, while other studies suggest that adolescents experiencing victimization across both mediums may suffer the highest levels of psychological distress, including suicidality (Schneider, O’Donnell, and Coulter 2012). Though the correlation between bullying victimization and suicidality is well-established, theorizing the causal link between the two is more elusive in the literature (Steger, Chen, and Cigularov 2013).

Most studies of the bullying-victimization and suicidality association focus on theories that explain suicidality as a resulting from the deleterious psychological consequences of bullying victimization (Barchia and Bussey 2010; Hay and Meldrum 2010). Social psychological theories focus more strongly on the social alienation/low belongingness experienced by victims of bullying, notably the concept of social support, or the support (including emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal) people feel they receive from others (Rothon, Head, Klineberg, and Stansfeld 2011). Social support is primarily conceptualized by past research as support from family, schools, and peers (Holt and Espelage 2007; Zhang et al. 2016). Social support is identified as a key moderator between victimization and psychological distress, including suicidality (Barchia and Bussey 2010; Holt and Espelage 2007; Zhang et al. 2016). Scholars familiar with early research on suicide by Emile Durkheim may notice some validation of his ideas in these findings. Specifically, it seems Durkheim’s ideas about heightened risk of suicide for those who experience less social integration (see “egoistic suicide”) is reflected in the moderating role played by social support in the bullying victimization/suicidality association (Durkheim 1897/1953).

Given the operationalization of bullying victimization and suicidal ideation in this study, it is difficult to suggest or make claims about causality and thus impossible to really test any specific theory of the association. However, the clear link established by past studies between bullying victimization and suicidal ideation suggests the likelihood of similar findings among adolescents in South Dakota. Hopefully, this study will serve to describe the prevalence of bullying victimization and suicidal ideation within South Dakota as well as the possible association between the two. This information is valuable for understanding the scope and consequences of bullying victimization at a local level.
