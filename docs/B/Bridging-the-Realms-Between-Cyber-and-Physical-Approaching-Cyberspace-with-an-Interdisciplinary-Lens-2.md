## Methodology
*Importance of Case Studies – Significance*

The case studies that I have chosen for this project explore how state powers employ cyber technology to influence and sway regional and international politics. These case studies also explore the effects of digitization in international relations. My case studies on North Korea and the United Arab Emirates demonstrate how the emerging cyberspace permits small states to compete on the same playing field as global superpowers such as the U.S., China, and Russia. Additionally, the Hong Kong National Security Law case study investigates digital media as a mechanism to publicize domestic affairs to a global audience, as well as how that mechanism can be censored by digital suppression. All three case studies share the common trait of employing their respective technologies to pursue geopolitical aims. Due to the ongoing fluctuations in cybersecurity developments, I found it most useful to gather data from sources from 2014 and onward. More importantly, I would like to use my thesis as an opportunity to suggest ways to move forward in the cyber realm.

A scientific or technical approach to handling cybersecurity challenges could help enrich an understanding of how intrusions occur. This paradigm alone, however, does not encompass the political or sociological motives for hacking, espionage, and disinformation, which I argue is the most crucial aspect to understanding cyberspace. In other words, the problem is not always a weak code or poor security, but what provoked the attack or action in the first place. I believe that North Korea, the UAE, and Hong Kong best exemplify this argument because they highlight the critical theme of a desire to protect state reputation. International Studies challenges us to critique the human actors, whether they are individuals, hacker groups, or entire nation-states. I find this the most useful way to approach cybersecurity challenges. Aside from investing in security development, cybersecurity requires understanding the human context in its political and social atmosphere.

*Method of Organization*

This paper will first outline the previous scholarly work on conflict in cyberspace. The literature review will develop a theoretical framework to make sense of the case studies presented in this project. More importantly, this literature review will strengthen my claims as to why there is a need to research this specific topic. Afterward, the case studies of The Sony Hack, the Qatari News Hack, and the Hong Kong National Security Law will be discussed with graphics to guide in telling each story. For each country, a background of the case study will be outlined, and key themes will be explored. Next, the analysis section will be broken into three subsections: reputation as a motivator for cyber warfare, establishing political influence through the use of technology, and the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on cybersecurity. Finally, the conclusion will summarize the arguments discussed and outline future questions to be researched in cybersecurity and political science.
