## DISCUSSION
In addition to providing descriptive data, the findings produced by this study yielded two important observations about adolescents in South Dakota: 1) overall bullying victimization was slightly higher in South Dakota relative to the nation in 2015, and 2) bullying victimization is significantly associated with suicidality, but adolescents who experience traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization appear to demonstrate the highest risk of suicidality.

Relative to the nation, South Dakota adolescents demonstrated significantly higher bullying victimization and little difference in suicidality. Though the overall proportion of bullying victims was significantly higher in South Dakota, this difference was only 4.4%. Since data were cross-sectional, it may be useful for future research to repeat these tests for preceding and subsequent years to understand whether this is a consistent pattern or perhaps a spurious single year fluctuation. If a significant trend is established, researchers may then wish to investigate variables that contribute to this difference.

Similar to past findings, data analysis from the 2015 South Dakota YRBS demonstrates bullying victimization as a significant predictor of suicidal ideation among adolescents in the state. Since this finding is congruent with the panoply of earlier bullying and suicidality research, we were not surprised by this observation. Given findings of previous studies, we also expected to observe differences in rates of suicidality between adolescents victimized by one form (traditional bullying or cyberbullying) versus both forms of bullying (Schneider, O’Donnell, and Coulter 2012). We did not expect such drastic differences in suicidality between one-form versus twoform victimizations. In some cases, groups experiencing both forms of victimization demonstrated two and three times the prevalence of suicidality versus those experiencing one form. This study is limited in explaining the nature of these differences. Are those experiencing both forms of bullying simply victimized more frequently? Do these forms of victimization work together in some way to magnify the psychological distress of either form? As technology evolves and adolescent social lives increasingly are integrated into the online world, stakeholders (e.g., education professionals, mental health professionals, researchers) must prepare to respond to new manifestations of bullying victimization. Further study should focus on better understanding the different forms cyberbullying may take and how cyberbullying might be employed simultaneously with traditional bullying to victimize youth.
