## Discussion and Analysis
The discussion and analysis portion of my thesis will offer speculations and suggestions for each of the case studies. In conducting research for this thesis, I would like to argue how much International Studies has to offer; not just to the computer science and cybersecurity fields but to all academic disciplines. International Studies offers a new way of critical thinking. The application of the International Studies lens to cybersecurity allows one to take a step back to see a bigger picture, which, in turn, can unveil the true nature of modern cyber challenges.

*Your Reputation Precedes You*

Max Weber defined power as the chances that an individual in a social relationship can achieve their own will in spite of resistance.<sup>42</sup> Those with limited or diminishing power may act to gain control over certain resources. Weber’s theory certainly applies to this thesis as power and reputation were the driving forces in each case study examined. I argue that aside from proper practice, one should consider the reputational risks which come from two essential factors: the speaker and the status. One must also consider the consequences that can follow from the use of technology in the context of societal engagement and public engagement. North

Korea’s rage against Sony was caused by Sony’s intention to tarnish North Korea’s image as a country not to be messed with. The wrong thing to do was to make a movie mocking North Korea in the first place. The Kim family’s cult of personality, which only began after Kim II-sung took power in 1948, shows this; if one does not show “proper” respect for the regime, there would be consequences. In regards to the UAE case study, demonstrates the extent to which the UAE, alongside Saudi Arabia, were unwilling to tolerate any deviation from its vision for this region and the lengths to which they would go to. After the election of former U.S. President Donald Trump, the UAE likely saw the new American presidency as an opportunity to start asserting power in the Middle East. With the momentum of paranoia and panic in the Gulf, it started the hashtag trend “قتر مع العالقات القطع “,or “cut relations with Qatar,” bringing more attention to Qatar’s fake statement. Similar to the UAE, China wanted to maintain a secure grasp of their domestic security, and the way to do this was through a security law that would limit any anti-government protest. With the overthrow of the Qings in 1912 and the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese are especially keen on keeping control of the population.

North Korea, the UAE, and China all share a characteristic of going to great lengths to maintain their reputation from foreign adversaries. North Korea’s method was coercion; the UAE employed a disinformation tactic; and China used digital surveillance and oppression on the semi autonomous region of Hong Kong. All three countries used cybersecurity tools as a means for political purpose which, in turn, has created a new and murkier cyberspace. Based on the findings of this research, I conclude that cybersecurity must be viewed holistically or with an interdisciplinary lens outside of computer science for solving issues that cannot be solved with a simple code. Cybersecurity is only perceived as a technical field that is dominated by computer scientists and engineers with limited knowledge of public culture or social dynamics. The hackers and spies behind the cyber tools learn to adapt and improve their techniques for the future, so it is important to understand where the root causes for cyber conflict are coming from.

*Controlling the Media Narrative*

In the 1930s, the U.S. welcomed the radio, which quickly became a golden phenomenon. By the start of World War II during 1939, nearly 28 million American households owned radios to receive their news. Eventually, this shifted when the 1960s and 1970s ushered in a new era of digital technology. Both technologies had such large attraction because it was an excellent way of uniting communities, especially during WWII, The Cold War, and the Vietnam War. What should be noted from this is that people could only really receive their news in one form; unlike today, where we can choose where we get our information from, the spectacle of news was pretty uniform. In “Confronting an Axis of Cyber” James Lewis’ chapter “Defining Rules of Behavior for Force and Coercion in Cyberspace” states part of the reason why it was easier for nation-states to come together in earlier times was because the world was recovering from various world wars that overwhelmed the international system. “This is not 1945 when there was widespread consensus on the need for stabilising institutions, nor is it 1975, when Cold War opponents were ready to reach accommodations to increase stability.”<sup>43</sup>

The technological advancements in the 40 years between the 1930s and the 1970s is astonishingly different from those between the 1970s and the 2010s. Today, anyone with a device has the ability to control “the minds of the masses,” in the words of Malcom X. Media scholars classify the press as “the fourth estate” <sup>44</sup> exemplifying the considerable influence that the press had on public affairs. In England, this term was first used in Parliament as a group to be

added alongside the nobility, the clergy, and the commoners. Essentially, what makes the Internet so unique in this case is that online processes functioned as a mode for narrative control, which differs from conventional or military warfare in that it is much more abstract.

The idea that media is one of the most potent entities proves absolutely true in this thesis. Seeing Sony suffer horribly while controlling what the world saw was far more rewarding for North Korea than hacking the multinational entertainment corporation itself. North Korea's goal of preventing the movie from being shown had not followed as planned, but the hack's outcome almost certainly exceeded their expectations. The same can be said for the UAE and the planting of statements on the Qatari News Agency’s website. The UAE case study shows us a declining hierarchy of knowledge; one message brought an entire region into chaos, unveiling the underlying issues that the Middle Eastern already had in the Gulf coast. With the Sony Hack and Project Raven, these examples show that cyberspace allows diplomats and state governments to masquerade as cybercriminals. Lastly, Hong Kong’s use of technology, both on the protestor and the police force side, is the best example of technology being used to narrate the battle for public opinion. The Internet has become a token of political geography where online participation was crucial to the success of the Hong Kong protests. China's live news feeds, action information, and “intelligence” collected through cybersecurity surveillance have also shown us China’s attempts to uphold societal discipline and unity.

*COVID-19 Pandemic and Moving Forward* 

This year, the world navigated the stress and devastation of a deadly COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic inevitably interrupted a normal way of life and led to months of lockdown in all fifty U.S. states. As we continue to stay at home and limit ourselves from large social gatherings and other grand events, the use of communication platforms, such as Zoom and Google Hangouts, has risen exponentially. COVID-19 has also contributed to e-commerce with the adoption of online shopping and increased social media usage. With a greater reliance on digital technology to conduct everyday tasks, we have also become increasingly vulnerable to cybercrime.

Cybersecurity threats are estimated to double from $3 trillion to $6 trillion (USD) a year by 2021, and the number of cyber-attacks has increased five times worldwide after the COVID-19 outbreak.<sup>45</sup> With the heightened emotional states, individuals are more susceptible to falling for email scams such as ransomware attacks and phishing scams. On a much larger scale, there have been multiple cases of cyber hacks from Russia and China on the U.S.’s COVID-19 research. The pandemic has ultimately created a new set of practices in cyberspace, both domestically and internationally, which will ultimately have an impact on the ongoing Gulf Crisis and Hong Kong Security Law.

Out of all the three case studies, the COVID-19 pandemic is most relevant to the Hong Kong National Security Law. The Hong Kong law came amidst the coronavirus pandemic, and during the time of its announcement, the U.S. was very much distracted in handling their rising COVID-19 cases. With China’s desire to draw out foreign influence from Hong Kong, the timing of the national security law actually makes a lot of sense since their adversary, the U.S., was distracted by a global health crisis. The impeccable timing on China’s part makes it more difficult to undo and much harder for Hong Kong to gain back their state sovereignty. Combatting any form of Chinese human rights abuses will require more than just the declaration of the Hong Kong Human Rights Bill. Given the U.S.’ relationship with China, and depending

on the new presidency of the U.S. come inauguration of Joe Biden in 2021, strict economic sanctions actually may be the most effective method.
