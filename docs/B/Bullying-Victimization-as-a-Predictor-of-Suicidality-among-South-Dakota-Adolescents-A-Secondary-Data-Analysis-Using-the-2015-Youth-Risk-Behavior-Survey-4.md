## FINDINGS
Using 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Study data from both the South Dakota and national samples, two sets of analyses aimed to accomplish the goals of the study. These analyses included: 1) describe bullying victimization and suicidality in South Dakota, including comparisons with the national data and 2) statistical analysis testing bullying victimization as a significant predictor of suicidality among adolescents in South Dakota. 

### SOUTH DAKOTA IN A NATIONAL CONTEXT
The first goal of the study is to describe bullying victimization and suicidality in South Dakota within the context of the nation. When compared with the nation, the South Dakota population is whiter, more rural, more Christian, slightly less educated, and has a slightly lower median income (US Census 2017; US Census 2010; Pew 2017). Although these demographic differences do not specifically predict any state/national differences in bullying victimization and suicidality, they do demonstrate that the state is certainly not as demographically representative of the nation as other Great Plains states like Texas or Colorado. Thus, data from the state and national surveys were used to describe prevalence of bullying victimization and suicidality at each level. Additionally, one-sample z-tests for proportions were employed to conduct comparisons of state and national differences. These descriptive data and the comparison between state and national data are useful for better understanding the prevalence of adolescent bullying victimization and suicidality in South Dakota relative to the nation.

Table 3 displays the frequencies of bullying victimization among adolescents from the 2015 South Dakota and national YRBS. Respondents were categorized according to the form of bullying victimization experience, including: 1) bullied at school, 2) cyberbullied, and 3) bullied at school and cyberbullied. When compared with the national data, South Dakota displays a higher percentage of victimized youths across all three forms of victimization. Though none of these state-level proportions were significantly higher when isolated by victimization form, a one sample z-test of proportions revealed that the combined victimization percentage of South Dakota of 28.8% was significantly higher than the national population proportion of 24.4% (+4.4%, p<.5)  The 4.4% higher percentage of bully victims in South Dakota does not reflect higher suicidality.

While bullying victimization was slightly higher among South Dakota adolescents relative to the U.S., the reverse was true for suicidality. Table 4 outlines descriptive data from the state and national YRBS for four measures of suicidality: 1) considered suicide, 2) made a suicide plan, 3) attempted suicide, and 4) injurious suicide attempt. Each question was “yes/no” apart from the “attempted suicide” measure, which was recoded from an ordinal variable measuring the number of suicide attempts to a dichotomous variable measuring only whether respondents attempted suicide. Once again, a onesample z-test of proportions was used to test for significant differences between the state and national proportions. Overall, the proportion of South Dakota adolescents reporting suicidality across all measures is slightly lower, however, the only significant difference of proportions was for respondents who made a suicide plan. Around 12.6% of adolescent respondents in South Dakota reported making plans for suicide, which was significantly lower than the national percentage of 15.4%. This result was somewhat surprising since the South Dakota suicide rate is highest among those 15-24 years of age, which is “more than double the national rate, 25.0 vs. 11.1, respectively” (Kightlinger et al. 2017:6).

### BULLYING VICTIMIZATION AS A PREDICTOR OF SUICIDALITY 
Apart from delivering descriptive data on bullying victimization and suicidality within South Dakota, the substantive hypothesis tested in this study was that bullying victimization is a significant predictor of suicidality among adolescents in the state. Four different chi-square tests of independence were employed to test for significant association between forms of bullying victimization (not bullied, bullied at school, cyberbullied, and bullied at school and cyberbullied) and each measure of suicidality (considered suicide, planned suicide, attempted suicide, and injured by attempted suicide). Table 5 summarizes the descriptive data from these chi-square tests and indicates whether associations were significant. Two findings are highlighted here: 1) bullying victimization appears to have a significant positive association with suicidality and 2) suicidality appears to vary by form of victimization.

As indicated by Table 5, bullying victimization was found to be a significant predictor of suicidality among adolescents in South Dakota. Specifically, chi-square tests of independence found that bullying victimization was a significant predictor of considering, planning, and attempting suicide at the p<.01 level. Bullying victimization was not a significant predictor of injury from a suicide attempt, which only included respondents who had attempted suicide. This could be because there is no association, a result of the stochastic nature of injury from attempts, or perhaps because over 20% of cells in this chi-square fell below an observed frequency of 5 – a violation of chi-square assumption that decreases its predictive power. Measures of association were also calculated for each significant relationship using Cramér's V. Chi-square tests between bullying victimization and considering suicide, planning suicide, and attempting suicide yielded Cramér's V values of .315, .314, and .313 respectively. These values indicate moderate associations between bullying victimization and these three expressions of suicidality. Examining variation in suicidality across forms of bullying victimizations reveals further insights.

Combining the two measures of bullying victimization from the 2015 YRBS provided the ability to examine variations in suicidality across different victimization experiences. Table 5 displays that suicidality varied dependent upon the forms of bullying victimization experienced by respondents. While most victims reported no suicidality, those respondents who reported that they were “not bullied” expressed the lowest prevalence of suicidality across all types of ideation. Conversely, respondents who experienced both forms of victimization (bullying at school and cyberbullying) had the highest levels of suicidality. When examining those who “considered suicide,” for example, about 10.2% of adolescents who were “not bullied” reported considering suicide. The percentage of non-victims who considered suicide was thus less than half of the 22.6% of respondents who were bullied at school and the 28.6% of respondents victimized solely via cyberbullying. Experiencing both forms of victimization seems to present the highest risk for suicidality with 46.4% of respondents who were bullied at school and cyberbullied reporting that they had strongly considered suicide in the last 12 months. With the exception of those injured by suicide attempts, the prevalence of considering, planning, and attempting suicide was highest for respondents experiencing both forms of bullying victimization. Some variations in prevalence of suicidality exists between adolescents who were only bullied at school versus those who were experienced only cyberbullying, but the difference in suicidality was largest and most consistent between those who experienced one form of bullying (bullied at school or cyberbullying) versus both. Suicide attempts were over three times as likely among victims of both bullying forms (26.7%) versus those experiencing one form (7.1% for bullied at school and 8.6% for cyberbullied). Though we cannot pinpoint the exact cause of the difference given the limitations of the data, these findings indicate that while either type of bullying victimization appears to increase risk of suicidality , being bullied at school and cyberbullied appears to substantially increase this risk.
