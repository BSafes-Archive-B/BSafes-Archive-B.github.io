## Limitations
The first and the most pressing limitation is that most of the sources concerning the case studies do not focus on human weaknesses when discussing the foundations of the event. Many cybersecurity experts only point out the fatal flaw of human error in not safeguarding their electronic devices or security infrastructure. As stated, cybersecurity tends to be dominated by programmers with experience only in technology and engineering, despite many cyber-attacks having a political or social motive. This can make it difficult to recognize the real reasons behind particular hacks, as sometimes the issue is not the security element but the action that prompts it. Indeed, one can install and implement all the necessary security protocols, but there is not, nor will there never be, a 100% hack-free device in this world. Data breaches are like cybersecurity’s Kryptonite. Research that discusses the complicated relationship between cybersecurity, international relations, and political science does not yet seem to be a major focus in the field. I hope to shed more light on conflict in cyberspace and offer speculation as to how to improve the cybersecurity environment in the future.

This research refers to digital censorship, disinformation, and political propaganda. It is possible that I have not uncovered all parts of my case studies if any material was concealed from the public domain. Certain countries with state-run media, such as North Korea and the UAE, have different reporting frameworks than independent media outlets. Adding to my previous statement, another limitation of this thesis is that some of the cited sources were pro-Western. For example, one of the books that I mainly used in this research is Adam Segal’s book *A Hacked World Order. *Segal does an excellent job at laying out the relationship between geopolitics and international relations but spends a good majority of his book critiquing the lack of freedom of digital privacy in non-democratic regimes. Due to the limited time to complete this thesis, I cannot go into depth on the regime types of each of my case studies. It would be interesting if I were to examine how regime type influences the use of cyber tools, as the three countries in this study score “low” on the Freedom Index.

My last limitation of this project is that these case studies are relatively recent and still developing. The books and research journals I found provide broad ideas of cyber warfare as it continues to evolve. The Hong Kong National Security Law is so recent from the completion of this thesis that most of the sources I could use for these two case studies are blog posts and news reports. Additionally, it was just reported as of December 2020 that there are talks of resolving the Gulf crisis with Qatar. I am hopeful that over time, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, more works may be published on these subjects as they are still ongoing and relevant to today.

In an increasingly competitive international landscape, cybersecurity becomes harder to manage as nation-states continue to use technology for political gain. Comparisons in the cyber field are imperfect because each nation-state has its own idea of what is acceptable, which may lead to variations in international norms. Cybersecurity is often perceived as an alternative form of warfare––with the possible exception of the U.S. and China––but not a main strategic actor in international relations. This project aims to bring awareness to the great potential that cybersecurity will have, and has had already, in an increasingly digital world.
