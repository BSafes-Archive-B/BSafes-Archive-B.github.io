## Conclusion: Deterrence and Reassurance
The policy of the United States must be to discourage the use of military force to upend the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. US foreign policy, however, must also consider the reality of the situation: military deterrence is becoming less credible than in the past. Additionally, relying on military power to deter Chinese aggression requires the US and Taiwanese governments to burden their citizens with high risks. A new approach to deterrence is needed, one that relies less on the dangerous threat of military force than is presently the case.

A twofold strategy of raising the costs of breaking Taiwan’s nest while faithfully maintaining the value of an unbroken nest is the most prudent way to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and, thus, avoiding a great-power war. China must be made to believe there are no overall gains to be had from a military invasion of Taiwan, whereas there are considerable advantages to maintaining the status quo. In the final analysis, a strategy based purely—or even mostly—upon military deterrence cannot achieve these goals. Unless US leaders are truly willing to fight World War III in defense of Taiwan, they would do well to consider strategies of deterrence that do not rely upon the threat of a military reprisal. We have argued it is possible to imagine such an alternative strategy of deterrence—one that relies on nonmilitary means of severe punishment rather than an expectation of being able to repel militarily a Chinese invasion.

That said, we are clear-sighted about the difficulties of orchestrating a credible strategy of deterrence by punishment. Not least of all, a broken nest strategy means accepting China can likely conquer Taiwan if it chooses to do so. It also means laying plans to destroy key Taiwanese infrastructure at great economic cost. Nonetheless, we maintain China could probably conquer Taiwan even if the United States intervened. Morevover, the social and economic costs of a great-power conflict would dwarf the targeted demolition of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry or the inevitable harms produced by an insurgency.

To conclude, the broken nest strategy hinges on the United States not taking any action that China’s leaders would interpret as an act of war. In such a situation, if Beijing did consider the United States an active belligerent, it might initiate first strikes against US forces. This possibility must be considered seriously. There are few ways to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan that involve zero risk of conflict. For the next decade or so, the best way to deter Chinese aggression while lowering the chance of a great-power conflict is to follow the path outlined above: if war, a broken nest; if peace, a tolerable status quo.
