## I. THE BIRTH OF BITCOIN: BLOCKCHAIN ORIGINS

The idea for a trustless, decentralized banking ledger originated from the mistrust of banks following a global recession. In 2008, the financial crisis was in full effect.<sup>10</sup> The world had previously seen a number of respected institutions fall at the hands of risky financial derivatives trading.<sup>11</sup> Banks had,

deservedly, become the derided pariah of society, due to essentially gambling with their customers’ mortgage premiums, pensions, retirement funds, and IRAs.<sup>12</sup> People were feeling the burn of a record number of foreclosures<sup>13</sup> and a widespread effect on the global economy.<sup>14</sup> People lost trust in banks and various governments’ ability to oversee and regulate them.<sup>15</sup>

Enter “Satoshi Nakamoto.”<sup>16</sup> In October of 2008, Nakamoto published a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”<sup>17</sup> His paper outlined the underlying deficiencies and inefficiencies of the current banking system.<sup>18</sup> Namely, as consumers, banking customers are required to “trust” banks to act as middlemen for the majority of daily financial transactions.<sup>19</sup> Unless one runs an all cash business, consumers and businesses are required to store money in the bank and rely on the banking system to facilitate and “verify” the transactions as they occur.<sup>20</sup> As only a relatively small number of banking institutions exist, the facilitation of these transactions are

centralized to a small number of global players, allowing them to essentially monopolize via their market share and, therefore, have free reign over consumers’ money.<sup>21</sup> The unwitting consumer, with no option but to utilize these “transaction facilitators,” is at the whim of these large global companies, trusting they will not misappropriate the funds in self-dealing transactions.<sup>22</sup> In addition, the centralization of transaction facilitators creates a weak point that hackers and bad actors can exploit.<sup>23</sup> When there is only one server, these actors need only gain access to that one server to do whatever they will with the information they find.<sup>24</sup> This has led to numerous security breaches in the financial sector, with millions of customer accounts impacted and compromised.<sup>25</sup>

Satoshi invented Bitcoin as an “electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”<sup>26</sup> Satoshi sought to recreate the positive aspects of banking, such as being relatively cheap, reliable, and verifiable, while leaving the negative aspects of necessary trust and centralization behind.<sup>27</sup> The system Satoshi created to meet these goals is called “blockchain.” Based on cryptography and Peer-to-Peer networking, blockchain utilizes the same Peer-to-Peer structures as “BitTorrent,” a

decentralized network of computers which contains information that can be shared with other computers on the network.<sup>28</sup> Much to the chagrin of publishers and distributors, some readers may recall using or still use “BitTorrent” today to download movies, music, books, or anything else.<sup>29</sup> Many media copyright holders have brought legal actions against infringers using the BitTorrent Network, presenting a slew of new issues courts must handle.<sup>30</sup> The BitTorrent technology may be an easier medium to illustrate how blockchain and Peer-to-Peer systems work and why it can have a transformative effect on all ledgering applications.
