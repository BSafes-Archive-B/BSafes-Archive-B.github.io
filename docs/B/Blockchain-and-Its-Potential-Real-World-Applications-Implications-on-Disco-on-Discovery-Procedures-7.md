## VII. JUDICIAL NOTICE
Most lawyers are familiar with the concept of judicial notice. Judicial notice has a long history within the courts.<sup>149</sup> The

concept allows the court to take notice of readily accessible or publicly known information as adjudicative facts. The old common law precepts of the rule were codified into the Federal Rules of Evidence when they were put into effect in 1975.<sup>150</sup> Federal Rule 201 governs the ability of a judge to take notice of certain adjudicative facts of two kinds: (1) facts “generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction” (i.e., that a street leads to a different street); or (2) facts that “can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned” (i.e., the sky is blue).<sup>151</sup> Notice of transactions which occur on a blockchain would fall within the scope of the second category.

A judge may take notice at any stage of the proceeding,<sup>152</sup> either (1) of its own volition; or (2) if a party requests that notice be taken and supplies the necessary information required.<sup>153</sup> A party is entitled to be heard regarding the propriety of the judge’s notice.<sup>154</sup> In civil cases, facts judicially noticed must be accepted by the jury as conclusive, while in criminal cases the court “must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.”<sup>155</sup> The presumption of the facts judicially noticed allows for a streamlining of the process in laying the foundation for conclusive facts. To determine whether “a source proffered as worthy of judicial notice is one whose ‘accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,’ courts should look to three factors: (1) the source’s knowledge of the subject matter, (2) the source’s independence from relevant bias, and (3) the source’s motivation to ensure accuracy of the posted information.”<sup>156</sup>

In their application to blockchain, these factors lead one to believe that information stored on a certain blockchain is within the purview of judicially noticeable fact. The first factor analyzes the source’s knowledge of the subject matter.<sup>157</sup> With

blockchain, it cannot be questioned whether a blockchain has knowledge of the transaction in issue.<sup>158</sup> Blockchain explorers directly reflect the transaction that occurred.<sup>159</sup> The blockchain has intimate knowledge of which public key holders the transaction occurred between, what transaction or sums were transferred, and when the transaction occurred.<sup>160</sup>

Seemingly, this is only possible on a purely public blockchain where all information is freely available to the public. Privacy-Oriented, Private, and Permissioned blockchains all have an additional layer of protection which guards the public key holder’s information.<sup>161</sup> As such, the ability of the court to take judicial notice of transactions on these blockchains is significantly diminished. A Private or Permissioned blockchain may still allow public exploration,<sup>162</sup> if not, however, transactions which occur on these blockchains will generally require the third party which controls such information to be subpoenaed. At this point, we are left solely with blockchains that allow for public exploration of its transactions. Luckily, at the present time, the majority of financial blockchain transactions (cryptocurrency) are taking place on public blockchains umbrella and are still subject to analysis of the remaining factors.<sup>163</sup>

The second factor is the source’s independence from relative bias.<sup>164</sup> This factor again brings the remaining blockchains within judicial notice purview. Explorer outputs are merely a function of reporting the transactions which occurred on the blockchain.<sup>165</sup> The blockchain is unable to output information in a misleading way.<sup>166</sup> This technology is not subjected to prejudice or bribery. Blockchain has no implicit biases. Indeed,

the explorer is merely a reported representation of the transactions which occurred on the blockchain and is outputted as a matter of course.<sup>167</sup> This factor weighs in favor of allowing judicial notice.

The third factor, the source’s motivation to ensure accuracy, also militates toward judicial noticeability.<sup>168</sup> The entire premise of blockchain technology is underpinned by its immutable characteristics. Consortiums which design and engineer blockchains have the sole motivation to ensure the accuracy of the information which is contained on the blockchain.<sup>169</sup> Indeed, the invention of this technology in 2008 was directly motivated by the market manipulation and disingenuous practices that the centralized global players were partaking in.<sup>170</sup> The engineering of this technology arose directly out of a backlash for the inaccurate reporting done by centralized financial institutions.<sup>171</sup> The creators of blockchains and those who participate in the blockchain market by transacting in cryptocurrency utilize blockchain for its immutable characteristics.<sup>172</sup> Cryptocurrencies are not subject to the control of “banking cartels” that many tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorists believe exist.<sup>173</sup> The rising value of cryptocurrencies over the long term show that many are seeking alternatives to a banking and economic system they believe is rigged.

Additionally, the tangible value of blockchain and cryptocurrency assets is based upon the premise that the information on the blockchain is immutable.<sup>174</sup> The engineers which create blockchains are directly motivated to ensure that the information stored on the blockchain is reliable and accurate.<sup>175</sup> If this was not the case, the time, money, and effort

that went into the creation of the blockchain would be destroyed. Traditionally, the programmers which create blockchain technology are also the first miners of the currency.<sup>176</sup> When they started mining, the value of the currency was so low that many were rewarded with huge lots of cryptocurrency.<sup>177</sup> The value of their labor in programming and mining was paid in cryptocurrency.<sup>178</sup> Many of these originators have amassed huge amounts of cryptocurrency.<sup>179</sup> They are incentivized to not have the value of cryptocurrency fall precipitously, which it would, if it were found that the blockchain was unreliable.<sup>180</sup> The creators of each individual blockchain have a huge motivation to ensure the information which is stored on the blockchain is accurate, as long as they are not engaged in their own fraudulent conduct, which the cryptocurrency space is currently rife with.<sup>181</sup> However, as the sector matures and large institutions enter the space, these types of scheming opportunists should be eliminated by the market forces of laissez faire capitalism and government regulations of the American mixed economy.

Accordingly, *some*, but not all, blockchains may allow for the information which it contains to be judicially noticed. What will be important in determining whether a particular blockchain is subject to judicial notice is (1) the pervasiveness of the particular blockchain, (2) whether the particular blockchain is public and can be explored, and (3) the particular blockchain’s adherence to the fundamental motivations of blockchain technology. Not all uses of blockchain technology will be subject to judicial notice.

However, one can imagine a future where blockchain technology is so pervasive that judicial notice of such transactions will lead to a more cost-effective way to admit such evidence.
