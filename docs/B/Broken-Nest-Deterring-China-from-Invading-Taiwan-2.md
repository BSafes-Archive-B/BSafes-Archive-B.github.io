## The Threat of War
The US interest in preventing a PRC invasion of Taiwan is straightforward and compelling. If Taiwan fell to China, a successful democracy would be extinguished, and Beijing’s geopolitical position in East Asia would be enhanced at the expense of the United States and its allies.<sup>3</sup> Even analysts who caution against inflating the strategic importance of Taiwan accept the fact that . . . all things being equal, there are substantial costs and risks attached to abandoning Taipei to China.<sup>4</sup> Yet, the United States obviously has a countervailing interest in avoiding war with Beijing.<sup>5</sup> Such a conflict would be ruinous even if the United States *won*—a misleading term, perhaps, given even a military action that successfully averted a Chinese takeover of Taiwan would still leave the United States in the unenviable position of “becoming the permanent defense force for Taiwan.”<sup>6</sup> Needless to say, with the changing military balance in East Asia, it is entirely possible the United States would lose.<sup>7</sup> Of course, if a US-China war “went nuclear,” then the outcome could be nothing short of cataclysmic for people in the United States, Taiwan, China, and elsewhere.

No matter how much the United States wishes to preserve Taiwan’s de facto independence, the costs of war mean US responses suffer from serious

credibility problems. Relying on an explicit or implicit threat of war to deter China might even be counterproductive if it leads Beijing to assess that the military balance across the Taiwan Strait permits an invasion. For example, it might be rational for Chinese leaders to order an assault if they had intelligence suggesting the United States would not fight—or would fight and lose.

In previous decades, the United States enjoyed clear military supremacy over China, and thus, American deterrence capabilities were more credible. For example, in June 1950, President Harry Truman interposed the Seventh Fleet between mainland China and Taiwan “to ‘neutralize’ the Taiwan Strait” and to discourage Chinese forces from attempting an amphibious attack.<sup>8</sup> More than 40 years later, President Bill Clinton impressed America’s military superiority upon Chinese leaders with the dispatch of two carrier strike groups to the region—a show of force that, while successful in the short term, had the long-term effect of convincing China’s leaders to pursue massive investments in anti-ship ballistic missiles.<sup>9</sup>

Today, the United States has more difficulty engaging in such exercises of “deterrence by denial.”<sup>10</sup> The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is now powerful enough it probably could overrun Taiwan even if the United States intervened to defend Taipei. Both sides know this—or at least strongly suspect it. A Chinese analyst with connections in the PLA Navy told us the PLA’s goal for a successful invasion was 14 hours, while it projects the United States and Japan would require 24 hours to respond. If this scenario is close to being accurate, China’s government might well be inclined to attempt a fait accompli as soon as it is confident in its relative capabilities. This perspective is consistent with thinking expressed in the PLA’s 2013 *Science of Military Strategy,* which exhorts the nation “to strive to catch the enemy unexpectedly and attack him when he is not prepared, to seize and control the battlefield initiative, paralyze and destroy the enemy’s operational system and shock the enemy’s will for war.”<sup>11</sup>

Even if the United States intervened before China could secure a fait accompli, Chinese strategists have growing confidence the United States

would lose a war over Taiwan. If such a scenario played out, it would offer China a major victory in terms of domestic and international prestige— an enticing prospect for any leader, especially one intent on definitively reestablishing China as a great power. Chinese strategic thinking emphasizes the possibility and utility of limited wars and projects confidence in the ability of war handlers to bring such an engagement to a favorable political outcome. This strategy is precisely what the PRC attempted to execute in the Sino-Indian War in 1962, the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969, and the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979. The fact that all of these operations were successful militarily but failures politically seems to go unnoticed.

China’s geographic advantages and technological advances make it difficult for the United States to restore the credibility of a deterrence-by-denial strategy. At most, bolstering the number and type of US forces in the region could help reduce China’s expectations of a quick and decisive victory. Beijing would not remain passive in the face of an expanded US military footprint around Taiwan. To maintain long-term strategic advantage, the United States must be willing to participate in an all-out arms race with Beijing—one that could not easily be won, and which would substantially reduce the chances of finding a diplomatic solution to the dispute. This possibility does *not* mean China is altogether undeterrable. What it *does* mean is deterrence must be based more on threats of penalties in response to an invasion (deterrence by punishment) rather than threats to prevent conquest from succeeding militarily (deterrence by denial). If penalties for invading Taiwan can be made severe and credible enough, Beijing could still be deterred from choosing such a course of action.<sup>12</sup>

Of course, America’s current policy toward Taiwan is already partly based on the logic of deterrence by punishment—that is, an implicit threat to wage a war against China that might not be limited to the Taiwan Strait. The “AirSea Battle” concept, for example, included extensive strikes on the Chinese mainland.<sup>13</sup> From the US perspective, however, this military-heavy version of deterrence by punishment is grossly unattractive. Not only does China have good reasons to doubt whether the United States would follow through with escalatory attacks, but it is not clear that China would emerge as the biggest loser even if such strikes were meted out and China responded, either asymmetrically or in kind. Moreover, even winning such a war would not provide the United States and Taiwan a permanent sustainable resolution to the issue of cross-Strait relations. We agree with Andrew Scobell’s point that “for the

Taiwan issue to be resolved once and for all, the outcome must be satisfactory to Beijing.”<sup>14</sup> Below, we propose a deterrence-by-punishment strategy that does not hinge upon the credibility of a US threat to wage a great-power war against China and which, while not offering a roadmap to a permanent resolution, at least promises to lower the costs of the status quo for all concerned.
