## METHODS
Since 1991 the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has monitored health risk behaviors of U.S. adolescents (youths 12 to 18 years of age) through their Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (CDC 2015). A central feature of the CDC’s risk surveillance is a biannual Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) of “9th through 12th grade students in public and private schools in the United States” (CDC 2015). National YRBS data are available for download via the CDC website, while state level samples may be requested using the “data request form” provided on the same website (CDC 2015). Nearly every state in the United States and some U.S. territories participated in the 2015 YRBS high school survey, with the exception of Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota (CDC MAP 2017). However, not all state questionnaires mirror that of the national instrument. South Dakota, for example, is one of the 25 states that do not collect data on adolescent sexual orientation (Gifford 2017). Among the health-risk behaviors assessed by the YRBS at the state and national level are those that “contribute to unintentional injuries and violence” (CDC 2015), including bullying victimization and suicidality – the two key variables examined in this study. Despite some variation between the South Dakota and national questionnaires, the questions measuring bullying victimization and suicidality were the same. Before specifying these variables and the limitations of the YRBS, some basic demographics of the two samples used in this study are provided.

### SAMPLE
Demographically, the South Dakota and national samples display similarities in distributions of age and sex of respondents but noticeable differences in their racial and ethnic makeup. Table 1 displays some general demographic characteristics of the South Dakota and national samples. Distributions of sex were fairly even across both samples, though the percentage of females (51.1%) was slightly higher than males (48.9%) in South Dakota. Regarding distributions of age, South Dakota and U.S. samples were also very similar. Most respondents in each sample, around 75%, were between 15 and 17 years of age. The U.S. sample was slightly older (x̅= 16.04 years old) than the South Dakota sample (x̅= 15.84 years old), but this was a negligible difference relative to the more pronounced differences in race. The South Dakota sample included 37.7% more respondents who identified as White and 1.8% more respondents who identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, while the U.S. sample included just over 9% more Black or African American respondents and over 13% more Hispanic/Latino respondents. General relationships between race and ethnicity, bullying, and suicidality among U.S. adolescents are not well established, though there is some research suggesting slightly lower bullying victimization among Black adolescents (Spriggs et al. 2007; Wang, Ionotti, and Nansel 2009). Across racial/ethnic groups, bullying behavior (victimization and perpetration) is more strongly related to peer and family dynamics than race or ethnicity (Spriggs et al. 2007).

### MEASURES
The primary goals of this study were to provide insights into bullying victimization among adolescents in South Dakota, including describing the prevalence of bullying victimization and testing its relationship to suicidality. Across both the South Dakota and U.S. questionnaires, the 2015 YRBS included two measures of bullying victimization as well as four measures of suicidality. Table 2 details YRBS questions used to measure the independent variable of bullying victimization and the dependent variable of suicidality.

Bullying victimization was assessed with two questions assessing both traditional bullying (question 24) and cyberbullying (question 25) victimization, both with “yes” or “no” response options. One limitation of these questions is that they do not measure frequency, intensity, or duration of bullying activity, valuable information for testing different dimensions of the bullying victimization-suicidality relationship. Frequency of bullying victimization is associated with higher risk of suicidality (CDC 2014). Despite these limitations, we were able to produce new insights from the two bullying victimization measures by combining the two questions to identify respondents who were not bullied, only bullied at school, only cyberbullied, and bullied both at school and cyberbullied. Combining these variables resulted in the ability to test for any variations in suicidality by type of bullying victimization.

Table 2 also presents the more robust four-question assessment of suicidality. These measures of suicidality are reflective of other commonly utilized suicidality scales, including the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) – a scale with wellestablished validity and reliability for assessing severity of suicidality (Posner et al. 2011). Like the C-SSRS, the YRBS measures are also arranged in a gradation of severity (e.g., “seriously considered suicide”) to higher severity (e.g., suicide attempts, suicide attempt injury). This scaling permitted testing the relationship between bullying victimization and a gradient of less severe (i.e. suicidal thoughts) to more severe suicidality (i.e. suicide attempts) among adolescents.

### LIMITATIONS
Methodological limitations of this study stem from the sampling used by the Centers for Disease Control as well as the measures employed. First, approximately 3% of the U.S. school-aged population is homeschooled (NCES 2017). The YRBS samples from public and private schools, so homeschooled adolescents are not included in this study. Second, the questions utilized by this study to observe bullying victimization and suicidality are certainly not complete measures of either variable. Bullying victimization, for example, does not measure frequency, duration, severity, or other important dimensions. Additionally, establishing causality between bullying victimization and suicidality is difficult since these two variables are measured indirectly via two separate sets of indicators. In other words, questions asking respondents whether their suicidality was influenced by bullying victimization would be more useful in establishing time-order and, therefore, causality. Finally, questions are also self-report and thus the extent of underreporting or over-reporting of these behaviors is difficult to determine.
