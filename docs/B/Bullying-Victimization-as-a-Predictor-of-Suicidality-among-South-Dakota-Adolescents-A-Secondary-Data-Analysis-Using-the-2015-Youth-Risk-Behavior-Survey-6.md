## CONCLUSION
Advocates for addressing the problem of bullying victimization and suicidality among adolescents propose the use of a public health approach (Hertz, Donato, and Wright 2013). The first step in a public health approach for addressing problems is to define the problem, including the “magnitude, scope, characteristics, and consequences,” via collecting and analyzing data (WHO 2017). Data on bullying victimization, suicidality, and their association include a patchwork of studies across various states and the national level, which ultimately exclude an analysis specifically of South Dakota. Though not without its limitations, this study is a contribution toward addressing this shortcoming.
